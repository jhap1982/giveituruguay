NOTES:
Broadcasted live by Rock & Pop radio. After many years of seeking this broadcast, finally came across someone who taped it back in the day and sent me her tapes, albeit in very bad shape. I did my best while transferring but there are a few rough spots here and there apart from tracks 1, 8 and 15 which are badly damaged. Some cuts are also present in the tapes, mostly trying to remove banter or DJ comments but the "Red Hot Mama" jam and Flea's cover of "The Needle and the Damage Done" are also missing.
