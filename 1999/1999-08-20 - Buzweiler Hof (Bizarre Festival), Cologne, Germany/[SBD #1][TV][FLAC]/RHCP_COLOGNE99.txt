I have found this dat tape in my vaults and i thought it was
pretty good to share it.This comes from a digital satellite
recording made onto dat.The sound is very good and
the performance too.The levels on the original recording were
a little bit too hot.You can hear it in some songs("if you have to ask")
where there's a little bit of saturation on the left channel.
I've tried to recover it,to improve dynamics eq and stereo separation.
Now it sounds better and the transients have come back to life. 
I hope you'll like it.Play it loud!
