NOTES:
This is the complete video featuring all the songs with no channel logo, hence we assume it's taken from some kind of master tape.  The camera takes are pretty similar to the MTV broadcast's video, but the most notable difference is it has way less audience focus. Also, the audio is much clear due to quieter audience noise.
