notes:
this is their full broadcast and set. 
several other bands played at this show.
a second tape was used to get the encore
and nothing is missing from the recording
(except for all the words said not deemed 
acceptable for mid 1970's US gov't standards, 
which were censored out by audio termites.)
call it a politically climate change damaged recording.
other than that, it sounds fine, and the band puts on a fine show
in their 1st show in this area for several years.
