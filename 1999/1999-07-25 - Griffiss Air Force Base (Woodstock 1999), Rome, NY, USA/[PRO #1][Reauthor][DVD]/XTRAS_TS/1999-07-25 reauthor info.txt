This is a re-authored version of the digital rip from a reviewing of woodstock 3 in the USA, uploaded by jasonrhl. The audio in this re-authored version is from an older DVD of the show which was transferred from VHS and I think it sounds better. Only a few seconds at the beginning and the end are audio from the digital broadcast, because the older version was a little bit shorter. I also added a simple menu and the show can be watched in chapters.
