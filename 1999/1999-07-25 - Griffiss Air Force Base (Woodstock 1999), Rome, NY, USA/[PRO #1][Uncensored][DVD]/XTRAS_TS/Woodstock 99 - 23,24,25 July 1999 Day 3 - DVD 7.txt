Ok here's the deal. In 1999 I recorded all of Woodstock 99'. Over time Tape # 1 ( James Brown, Jamiroquai etc) was erased by my exwife accidently.
2 more tapes failed during recording incl. Dave Matthews Band, G.Love & Special Sauce, Bush & others. DMB was posted here earlier so no harm done. 
I was lucky, that some of the missing songs were shown again at times, when both stages weren't ready for the next band. So if that was the case, 
I filled those repeats into the spots, were the entire performance would have taken place. 
A pity, but we still have over 27 hours of good to excellent music presented here.
Highlights IMHO were Jamiroquai, Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Creed incl. Robbie Krieger, Godsmack, Metallica, Brian Setzer Orchestra and RHCP.
But there were many other really good acts throughout the festival. Clown Posse gets extra points for a totally outragious show (:.

For all the americans here, that might have problems with nudity, be aware that throughout this DVD-set naked people show up randomly.
So watch out.

Now enjoy the show, as I did then and many times since I created this DVD set 2 years ago.
