This show was for authorized fanclub members only. 
There were also some songs that didn't make it on the TV and radio broadcasts: two of those are "Under The Bridge" 
(they messed up and Anthony improvised a rap version) and "Yertle The Turtle / Freaky Styley Medley". 
They also did those songs during the soundcheck: "Right On Time", "Easily", "This Velvet Glove", "Parallel Universe", a couple of unknown and some BSSM tunes.
