you know not that it matters but it was

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,840
in the things uh day i wouldn't say dave

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
quit the band it just stopped being a

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,079
productive and fun

9
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,079
and creative experience for everybody

10
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,599
it was just kind of it ended naturally

11
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,198
like uh you know this is

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,879
this is not really what it's supposed to

13
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,399
be so let's

14
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,759
let's try uh moving on

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
but you were supposed to be very

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,799
productive for one hot minute

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,359
we were you was we were supposed to be

18
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
he was

19
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,040
oh he was yeah well he's you know he's a

20
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,560
good he's a he's a great guy and a great

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
guitar player and

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,400
that just kind of ran its course and

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
didn't really feel uh

24
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,879
didn't feel like what we were looking

25
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,680
for and then you know suddenly out of

26
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,199
the blue

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,040
fleece suggested that maybe we could

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,320
play with john again which was a

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,000
a terribly exciting prospect which

30
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,879
it was the furthest thing from my mind i

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,879
didn't think that was really a

32
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,399
a potential reality and then it turned

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,879
out to be so

34
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,399
it was a lucky day and john what was

35
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,158
your first reaction

36
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
what was the first to ask you to come

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,880
back fling

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
i came over to my house and we listened

39
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,280
to some music

40
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,000
um i was playing with some records and

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
then he

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
said uh something i wanted to talk to

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
you about uh

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
how do you feel about being red hot

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
chili peppers again you know i said

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,479
i said yeah yeah that sounds like it

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,080
could be good

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,039
and uh and we just started talking about

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
it

50
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,079
and we just seemed excited about it you

51
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,119
know

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,599
a lot a lot of uh

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,640
a lot of things have changed since since

54
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,598
the time that i quit

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,399
and we've we've joined together now in a

56
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,639
in a

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
way of uh we have a unity and a

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,719
closeness that

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,719
that uh that we had we'd gotten really

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,400
far away from before

61
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,519
can you define can you explain what is

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,280
different now into the papers

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,920
yeah yeah me and anthony were friends

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,759
now

65
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,919
we weren't friends back then one

66
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,079
difference it's one difference

67
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,958
and it's a big difference it's very

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
important

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
yeah it's very important for a band to

70
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,759
be friends with each other and to talk

71
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,598
to each other and

72
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,359
to enjoy each other's company because

73
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,639
you've got to be around these guys all

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,000
the time you know

75
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,279
so if if somebody's

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,919
you know somebody's way of life or

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,719
way of thinking isn't gelling with yours

78
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,000
it's a

79
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,719
it's a struggle and a pain to to go

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,318
on tour and to make music you know just

81
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,000
doesn't happen whereas when you love

82
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,958
each other you write songs you're proud

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
of each other you

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
you know you enjoy each other's

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,080
performance on stage

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,719
we weren't even looking at each other on

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,360
stage before i saw a videotape of us

88
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,400
back then recently from what show troy

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
new york

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
and we just we paid no attention to each

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,759
other nobody in the band paid any

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,719
attention to each other because it got

93
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,439
to the point where flea was so mad at me

94
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,759
and anthony for not but especially me

95
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,959
for

96
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,639
not trying at least from to me it seemed

97
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,759
like just me maybe you got to vibe from

98
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,000
him too

99
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,359
he was mad that that we weren't trying

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,919
to make it work

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
our relationship that we were just that

102
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,878
we weren't

103
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
trying for the sake of the band to be

104
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,120
friends we just were

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,919
like content to go around like hating

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,239
each other

107
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,839
and so he i fleece started being so mad

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,640
at me for that

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
that my fleet's relationship wasn't was

110
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,639
going downhill too

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
now we're all equally we're all happy to

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,319
be around each other and

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,439
be around you know and that makes for

114
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,918
making

115
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,079
good music you know at the time that he

116
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,599
asked me to join the idea of

117
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,439
getting together every day and making

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
music with people who i love who have

119
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,560
who share a similar vision of what the

120
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
purpose of music

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,199
is was just sounding like the greatest

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,680
don't you think that sometimes it's

123
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
safer to be in a band just on a

124
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,120
professional level

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,800
and not personal level i'm not worried

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
about that and i wasn't worried about it

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
when i quit

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,439
and it's never been like that for this

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
band

130
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,959
it didn't start like that and it never

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
really got to that point and

132
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,239
i don't think anybody was ever looking

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
for a uh

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,038
a safety net to be in this band i mean

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
i don't think it would be very good if

136
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,000
if that's the arrangement you know if we

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,600
just got together for

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
for making music it just wouldn't be the

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
way it is

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,280
yeah i don't need that kind of safety

141
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,279
you know

142
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,159
it's not the way i approach everything

143
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,879
but one of the reason uh for your

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
debater

145
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,079
was the pressure

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
no the pressure on the band yeah no i

147
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,280
didn't quit the band because of the

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,319
pressure on the band i

149
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,559
i think at the time since i quit

150
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,399
and then me and flee or me and anthony

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,759
we never really

152
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,839
discussed the reasons why they were just

153
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
asking me why and i just said i have to

154
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,918
you know it's just a feeling now i

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,038
understand why i did it

156
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,599
like and uh

157
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,879
but like so they used they probably said

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,039
that like uh

159
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,800
pressures of uh being successful john

160
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,560
couldn't handle it

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
flea i've heard him say thanks to that

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,319
effect you know

163
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,399
but it's not but that's not the case it

164
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
had nothing to do with the pressures

165
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,638
you know there's no nobody was putting

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
any pressures on me

167
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,439
because i wasn't i decide like i wasn't

168
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,680
doing any interviews at that time

169
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,439
only pressures were going on tour and

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,160
playing music and i loved playing music

171
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,560
every night

172
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
but the going on tour part of it is no

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
fun if

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,199
the people you're on tour with aren't

175
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,319
your friends you know

176
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,120
it starts to just be a drag you know

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
so so yeah i mean it's not i don't

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,639
really consider them pressures

179
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
you know i just i didn't like doing the

180
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,240
whole thing that you do being in a band

181
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:48,079
without you know and until

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:52,400
you take this is this bad departure

183
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:54,240
as a betrayal was it was it painful

184
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,918
it was definitely painful and i didn't

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,598
understand what was happening

186
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,918
you know i wasn't really sensitive

187
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,120
enough to the situation

188
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,279
to know what he was feeling or why he

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
was doing the things he was doing

190
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,478
you know my vision was a bit narrow at

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,800
the time and

192
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,038
and uh i just wanted to keep playing i

193
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,280
really liked the record that we made

194
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,879
um i was probably missing something that

195
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,638
we had from the past when we used to go

196
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,279
play live shows together and

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,960
have a great communication on stage and

198
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,399
i wanted that again you know very

199
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,918
desperately

200
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,239
you know because it was just something i

201
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,478
was missing and

202
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
uh you know i definitely resented him

203
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,680
for a while when he quit but it was it

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
wasn't coming from a

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
a focused place of understanding it was

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,879
just kind of a free-floating resentment

207
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,560
like

208
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,560
you know this just sucks and you know

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,639
why does he have to go do that and

210
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
but much more powerful to me at the time

211
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
was just a real

212
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,800
sense of loss and and i knew that

213
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,240
somewhere in there that i had done

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
something

215
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,639
that was you know that was selfish

216
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,120
enough to where it didn't work

217
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,199
and um you know i just missed him and i

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,478
was pissed off at him and

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,240
you know i cared about him and and

220
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,680
really you know that was a lot of stuff

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
that happened and i guess you're curious

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,439
about it because

223
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
it was a big explosion at the time but

224
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,079
you know never

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
in my wildest dreams did i think that

226
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,959
that we'd come together again to play

227
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
music

228
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,478
no i never i never considered it you

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
know i

230
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,318
my main thing was just that i wanted

231
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
john to know that i that i did love him

232
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,319
and that

233
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,120
i didn't want either of us to die

234
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
without you know reestablishing a

235
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,959
connection

236
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
and um and that was my biggest fear is

237
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,759
that you know either i'd get a call one

238
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
day saying

239
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,519
john is dead and i would have never been

240
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,000
able to tell him that even though she

241
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,839
got [ __ ]

242
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,559
up i still love you and i still care

243
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,320
about you and i think about you

244
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:50,479
so you know just the first day that we

245
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,839
started playing together i felt

246
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
a huge blessing and and then it just got

247
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,720
more and more fun

248
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:01,519
and you needed

249
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
in mind to reform a winning team a

250
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,799
winning team yeah we had it in mind to

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,759
reform a winning team

252
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:12,879
but you know that's that's a sort of a

253
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,000
an intellectual prospect that is easier

254
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,240
said than done you know we definitely

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240
wanted to carry on and

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
and we tried many times you know we

257
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,399
played with so many different people

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
after he left

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,720
and and never found uh

260
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,320
a beautiful chemistry you know we we

261
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
never found a chemistry where we were

262
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
happy and where we were creative

263
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,480
and where we all understood each other

264
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,240
and and had a desire

265
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,399
every day to play with each other you

266
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,839
know it became more of

267
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
just something to do because we were

268
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
supposed to do it

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,039
and uh and that changed you know the

270
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,799
minute we got together like this again

271
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,919
it just became

272
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,599
we're doing it because we love it yeah

273
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,799
we had to we tried to get a winning team

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
uh

275
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,000
you know there's there's not a lot of

276
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
first uh first-round draft choices out

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,799
there

278
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
for instance was it obvious to you to to

279
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,719
use again

280
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,600
rick robin as a producer was it obvious

281
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,040
uh

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,920
for one hot minute or for this record

283
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,439
it was not obvious it was not obvious we

284
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,838
we became so in love

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
with the the experience of playing music

286
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,600
and writing

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,560
songs over the summer we were very

288
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
committed to it

289
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,759
and suddenly we realized that we were

290
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,200
onto something

291
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,439
very special and that the songs we were

292
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
writing were as good as any songs we had

293
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
ever written

294
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
and we wanted a producer who had the

295
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,679
same kind of

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,959
all-or-nothing enthusiasm for for the

297
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,199
record we're about to make

298
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,479
because that's all we cared about and

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
that's all we were focused on and at

300
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
first we maybe had doubts

301
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,360
we were devoting our whole lives to the

302
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,519
record and rick was

303
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
seemed like he he likes doing a bunch of

304
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
things at once you know

305
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,839
he normally produces a couple albums at

306
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,759
one time plus runs his record company

307
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,279
and we felt that he might be too

308
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,078
distracted you know

309
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,838
that he couldn't give himself to us 100

310
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,000
right

311
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,320
so it crossed our mind but in the end

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
it was a the greatest thing to to work

313
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
with him

314
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,879
because he fell in love with the music

315
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,639
just like we did and probably worked

316
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,720
harder and longer

317
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,078
and and more from the heart than than

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,040
any of the other times we ever worked

319
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:16,639
with him

320
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,799
you know he's do right now as we're

321
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,039
sitting here he's in new york

322
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,399
you know doing uh extra work to make

323
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,319
sure that everything is perfect for the

324
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,159
mastering of our record

325
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,839
which is not like rick to do something

326
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,838
like that

327
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,159
[Music]

328
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,639
blood sugar sex and magic was a massive

329
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,278
but do you consider the album as a

330
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,278
masterpiece

331
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,000
or is it just a step in your musical

332
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,039
evolution

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
yeah i mean i i just think of it as the

334
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,679
songs that we wrote

335
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,559
during a really great year you know

336
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,479
during like uh

337
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,638
probably the happiest time of my life

338
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,278
that i've ever had

339
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,200
uh you know through the songs that we

340
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,600
wrote during that time period and

341
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,480
we recorded them you know and then the

342
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
period ended

343
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
like i don't see the f no i don't see

344
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,079
the final things being a masterpiece but

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,600
i see it as you know another great album

346
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,958
there are probably a couple of songs on

347
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,079
that record that could have stayed home

348
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,078
and not made it on the record

349
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,078
but what about the song like under the

350
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,159
bridge um

351
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,199
was it in a way a curse or a blessing to

352
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,439
write a song

353
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
i think that song is probably close to

354
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,639
being a masterpiece considering it's

355
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,919
only like two and a half minutes and

356
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
it's really like

357
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,278
is that yeah it's real short i had no

358
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,279
idea i had no idea

359
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,958
yeah and it's really powerful you know

360
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,240
i'm just like

361
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:59,359
i'm very happy we wrote that song i mean

362
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,680
that song is a very sad song you know

363
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,600
when anthony first came in with the idea

364
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,159
for the vocals and the lyrics were just

365
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
like oh

366
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:10,078
jesus yeah it was it was funny because

367
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,759
i i wasn't going to take it in i

368
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,879
definitely wasn't going to take it in

369
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,600
to the to the band practice and then uh

370
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,679
and rick

371
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,360
looked at it in my notes and he's like

372
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,078
well hello what about this and i was

373
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
like ah

374
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,359
please please let's move on and he said

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
no i think you should go in there and

376
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
sing that

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,679
and the day i went to sing it it was

378
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,920
just chad and john flee was late or

379
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,679
didn't come that day or something and i

380
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,879
was just so prepared for them to kind of

381
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,799
go okay

382
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,320
thanks for sharing but you know we got

383
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,078
other things to move on to and they

384
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,519
they got sad but it was not a curse

385
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,198
it wasn't a curse just because you have

386
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,959
a popular song that

387
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,639
you know people associate your band with

388
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,159
it doesn't matter in the end

389
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,720
but in a way you were ashamed to to

390
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,519
express those feelings of loneliness and

391
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
sadness

392
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,759

your words and

402
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,278

you work

473
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,038
at bixler all together to

474
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
just to practice and making music and

475
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,879
for one

476
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,798
augmented i guess if i can remember you

477
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,159
were in hawaii all together

478
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,599
the ban i mean uh you need from time to

479
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,640
time together

480
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,439
all the band and just play music for the

481
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
pleasure of it

482
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,440
uh yeah those were two different

483
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,960
experiences though

484
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,640
you know when we went to hawaii it's

485
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,200
because we were we were looking to

486
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,360
establish some you know communication

487
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,880
and experience together

488
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,639
that was just different you know when

489
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,440
when the when we went to big sur it was

490
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,600
just

491
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,279
flea and john and myself and it was

492
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,359
purely for fun and we had

493
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,399
one small mission which was to write an

494
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,158
acoustic song

495
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
that's one just one single song with

496
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
acoustic instruments

497
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,439
and to go surfing and to you know have

498
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,038
some good food and listen to music on

499
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,840
the way up and flea just got in a new

500
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,679
truck

501
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,678
so we were breaking it in that was

502
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,159
purely a road trip

503
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
you know just for the sake of fun and

504
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,600
you know it was

505
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,558
yeah we were there for a few days and we

506
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,678
just

507
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,279
only you know a few hours like three or

508
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,880
four hours were probably spent writing

509
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,678
that song you know

510
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,600
the bulk of it just being uh anthony

511
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,640
writing lyrics will mean flavor taking

512
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,918
naps

513
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,280
usually in the into the credits um

514
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,960
the old band sign the songs but how do

515
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,279
you work actually

516
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
the whole band sang the same songs oh

517
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,720
sign the sound

518
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,720
yeah how do you work actually is it

519
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,759
always a a song

520
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,480
came always from a gem between the all

521
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,400
of us

522
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,319
of you well it's always never

523
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
anything everything it's always

524
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,439
different sometimes i start a song

525
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,240
by but with an idea on the guitar and

526
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,919
plea writes a bass line and chad writes

527
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,519
a drum part and then we all just talk

528
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
about what other kind of section the

529
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,079
song needs and

530
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,918
then then that comes along and then

531
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,639
anthony starts seeing something that

532
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,640
makes us think of something else and

533
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,720
you know or our song could come from

534
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,000
chad just playing a drum beat and

535
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,360
us playing along with him and you know

536
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,038
they come all different ways

537
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,119
all different combinations yeah there's

538
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,798
no set way there's no formula

539
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,479
and there's no boundaries it can go

540
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,319
wherever it wants to go

541
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,079
and in the end the way we figure is that

542
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,079
we all

543
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,279
eventually put into it so like we

544
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,839
thought that california

545
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,678
i mean we thought that uh the song road

546
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,359
trip and needed drums chad's

547
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
input and the reason he gets the writing

548
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,000
credit on that song is because he

549
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,158
said no drums she said it doesn't need

550
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,038
any drums and we figure that's worth the

551
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,720
credit for that

552
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,960
that's a good point that's a good point

553
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,558
of view genius

554
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,919
um i wish she'd have that idea more

555
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:40,720
often just kidding

556
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
um can you can you summarize the album

557
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,319

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,720
magic and loss you familiar with that

569
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,359
one yeah

570
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,960
i'm not really big on summarizing it was

571
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,918
we had so much fun making it

572
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,279
it felt so good to be back together and

573
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
to be

574
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,519
going in the direction that it would

575
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,119
have only happened with

576
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,480
getting together every day like that you

577
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,239
know we couldn't imagine what we were

578
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,759
going to come up with and

579
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,359
it just felt so good to come up with

580
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,839
these songs and

581
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,399
um i think it's as good of a record as

582
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,399
we ever made

583
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,079
it's based on everything not just loss

584
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,960
it's it's

585
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,278
more based on the opposite of loss you

586
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,798
know

587
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:47,759
uh you know re-blossoming of sorts right

588
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,879
yeah because you talk over and over

589
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,240
about the pleasure you

590
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,320
you had making the album but

591
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,359
the album seems to me very sensitive and

592
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,960
in a way

593
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:02,000
a bit uh serious and

594
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,079
and and

595
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,400
hurtful in a way yeah well there's

596
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,879
pleasure to be had with those things

597
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,798
yeah i mean a lot of the time the music

598
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
that some of the music that gives me the

599
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,679
most

600
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,959
that makes me feel the happiest is music

601
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,559
that's uh

602
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,759
that people say is sad or depressing or

603
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,960
something

604
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,759
but that's because you know me

605
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,600
with music you can you can uh recreate

606
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,960
all kinds of feelings that

607
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:34,000
that exist in the universe you know

608
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,640
and and uh

609
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
and i think on our new album has a wide

610
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,600
spectrum of them you know

611
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,720
it's not any one kinds of songs i just

612
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:48,079
i like the the way that we've gone

613
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,720
that we've gone about ex uh

614
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,399
letting the feelings come through us and

615
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,880
expressing them with our instruments in

616
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,200
a way that sounds really uh

617
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
modern but at the same time takes roots

618
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,759
from the

619
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,918
kind of uh the kind of originality and

620
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,798
colorful playing that people did during

621
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,600
the periods of

622
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,558
new wave and punk rock and but at the

623
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,678
same time

624
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,639
it sounds modern and without having any

625
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,919
electronics

626
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,840
and still each section has its own

627
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,240
texture and feeling to it

628
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,599
i'm real proud of all that the song

629
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,640
californication

630
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,918
i read those lines destruction leads to

631
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,120
a very rough road

632
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,440
but it also breathes reads creation does

633
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,639
it

634
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,038
apply to you to the papers i mean

635
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
to the papers yeah yeah it applies to us

636
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,359
for sure

637
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,200
for sure i think it applies to

638
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,399
everything in the universe but

639
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,400
specifically that

640
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,600
to me was uh descriptive of of

641
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,360
my personal life and of my life in this

642
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,599
band and

643
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,599
just

644
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,630
all of those things that that didn't end

645
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,798
up destroying us

646
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,919
[Music]

647
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,599
you know led to this so and this was

648
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,840
very creative

649
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,918
very creative time in all of our lives

650
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,480
but do you think it's very necessary

651
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,360
do i think it's very necessary don't you

652
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,240
want to change it

653
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,639
change my change the way the way you you

654
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
need

655
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,759
difficulties well i didn't try to create

656
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,278
it in the first place it just happened

657
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,759
yeah i mean there's certain things in

658
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:29,440
faith you have no control over you know

659
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:32,879
faith like is the way it is you can only

660
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,038
force yourself upon your fate in

661
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,240
simple ways like what you eat and and

662
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,879
how much you smoke

663
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,720
and and what you say to your friends and

664
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,520
what you say to the people you pass by

665
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,519
in the street

666
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,519
but all the rest of it it's just stuff

667
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,918
that happens to you you know

668
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,960
the songs you write you it's not your

669
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,200
decision you know

670
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
that whether or not you go through hard

671
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,319
times whether or not

672
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,759
somebody dies whose friends who's a

673
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,759
friend of you is

674
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,440
whether or not you you start destroying

675
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,440
yourself like

676
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,240
these are things you don't have all

677
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,240
saying you know

678
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,400
but you need four years to make a brand

679
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,439
new album

680
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,559
is this novel

681
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,720
and we don't we didn't need four years

682
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,398
i mean once we got together it was a

683
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,960
year ago today or something like that

684
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,719
that we got together so

685
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,038
and and when we talk to you in a year

686
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
from now we'll have a new record

687
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,158
yeah this record didn't take us four

688
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,839
years to make

689
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,919
took us about nine months

690
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,678
and in the recording of it itself took

691
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,679
only about three weeks

692
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,639
that's very quick you know yeah um

693
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,480
in the future we're going to try to put

694
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,679
out a record every day

695
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,480
so i can wait for that

696
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,679
um i wrote an interview of flea where

697
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,759
where he said that

698
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,159
he is very uncomfortable with rich

699
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,158
people

700
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,720
because when he grew up he ate rich

701
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:06,639
people what about you

702
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,640
are you more comfortable than he is

703
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,240
that's a funny thing to say

704
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,079
makes no difference to me makes no

705
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
difference to me

706
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,839
i would say i'm less comfortable around

707
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,398
rich people than i am around poor people

708
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,119
but

709
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,639
i don't know i mean you know i'm the

710
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,079
same way as play i didn't have money

711
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,000
when i was a little kid we were in

712
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,439
welfare and stuff

713
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,440
that means that's like where you get

714
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,360
money from the

715
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,159
government because you can't get a job

716
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,479
when you're a kid and stuff

717
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,480
um

718
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
have you ever fallen in love with a rich

719
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,840
girl

720
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,440
no nope have you ever fallen in love

721
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,918
with the rich girl

722
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,919
neither okay

723
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,159

724
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,679
a girl who is dirt poor

725
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,640
in a week-to-week style but you know i'm

726
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,000
friends with flea and

727
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:13,840
flea's pretty rich so i guess i'm

728
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:13,839
comfortable with that
