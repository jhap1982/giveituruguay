Notes
Rescheduled from May 17, 2016.

Exclusive show for iHeart Radio, tickets were only obtainable through a contest and cameras or phones were strictly not allowed. 
Thundercat joined on bass for "Go Robot". "Sick Love" was performed twice to allow for edits as there were mistakes made while playing it the first time.

PRO #1
professional videosoundboard > unknownWEB > TS [720p]Sourced from a webstream, missing the first take of "Sick Love" and "Universally Speaking". 
There was also a TV broadcast by DirecTV, but as of now no transfers have been surfaced.
