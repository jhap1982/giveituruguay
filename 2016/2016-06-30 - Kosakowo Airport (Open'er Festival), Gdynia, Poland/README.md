## Recordings

* SBD #1 soundboard audio: soundboard > unknown FM > FLAC From a FM radio broadcast. "Can't Stop" and "Snow ((Hey Oh))" weren't broadcasted.
* PRO #1a professional video: soundboard > unknown WEB > MP4 [720p] Streamed live by "onet.tv", unfortunately there was a cut after "Around The World" and it's missing "Detroit" and the first half of "By The Way". Also, the audio was a bit off sync for the whole recording, however it's been corrected on the circulating rip.
* PRO #1b professional video: soundboard > unknown WEB > TS [720p] A few days after the show, the video was available for streaming on "onet.tv". However, it's missing "Can't Stop" and "Snow ((Hey Oh))" but features "Detroit" and the first half of "By The Way", missing on PRO #1a due to technical issues during the live stream.
