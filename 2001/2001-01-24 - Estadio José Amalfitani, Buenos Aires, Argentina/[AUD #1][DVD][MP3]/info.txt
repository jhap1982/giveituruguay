It was a great show, they started with a bass solo, like usual, and then immediately "Around The World". Their covers of "Beverly Hills" and "I Just Want Some Skank" by The Circle Jerks were fantastic, but Flea and Anthony speaking spanish was even greater! The final jam was 8 minute long, it was amazing, and with that they closed one of the best shows they've ever played.
