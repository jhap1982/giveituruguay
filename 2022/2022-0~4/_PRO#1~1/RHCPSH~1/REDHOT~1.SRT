permission from him to cover it on an

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,638
album plea was saying what a good idea

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,719
it would be to to

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,039
to do a heavy metal version of higher

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,960
ground you know that was your idea and

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,118
you you were like because it was in the

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
80s when there was so much bad heavy

13
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,599
metal and flea was like heavy metal can

14
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,678
be so rocking you know we definitely

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,960

you know

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120

00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,199
courageous thing you know like for us it

19
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,919

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
just curious like

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,119
you know what would happen yeah what

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,600
would happen yeah

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,000
this is what happened

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
look in that baseline flea you show off

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,719

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,679
and then the drum kicks in

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,679
oh that's so nice

29
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,358
