1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
it must be great for the three of you to

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,839
have john back in the band

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,679
because john seems to be that catalyst

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,519
that that guy who makes you guys elevate

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,040
your game is that a fair assumption to

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,400
make because every time john's in the

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,000
band

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,600
the the band the band just seems

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,278
like it it goes to a certain level

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,278
john that's a good that that's a fair

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,879
assumption he is a

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,399
he's more than a catalyst he is a

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,599
catalyst

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:34,238
but he's our brother he's our family and

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,799
i think just being around him and seeing

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,119
how much he pours into what he does is

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,000
infectious it's contagious

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,959
um it's inspiring literally inspiring

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,159
not just like oh wow i'm inspired but

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,558
he offers ingredients and love and hard

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,878
work and for sure it makes us want to do

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,799
better work harder what made you ready

23
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,159
to come back for this album it was a

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,640
certain amount of

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,358
soul searching that i'd done

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
it seemed like i changed and grown

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
enough as a person to where

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,960
it felt like it would be a beautiful

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,040
thing to have another chance to do it

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,839
right i felt that way when i rejoined

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,240
the first time uh on a personal level

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,560
and on a musical level i had some new

33
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,879
ideas about where i thought those

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,439
relationships could go and it was the

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,118
same thing this time i just

36
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,719
i i was seeing

37
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,560
anthony and flea and chad through a

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,039
different lens than i had seen them

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,719
through when i quit not that either time

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
that i quit that it was specifically

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,158
anything to do with personal but

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
you know

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
having a personal relationship in a band

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
is is a hard thing you've got to be in

45
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,879
sync with four people

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
working as hard as they work doing

47
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,839
you know

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
going where they go doing what they do

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
almost thinking what they think

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
it's an intense thing to do you know and

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,759
so i've found for myself that that that

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,599
i've needed a i've needed to clear my

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,759
head of it and

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,640
try to figure out who i am as a person

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,799
and i really wanted to have that have

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,439
that closeness and that kind of

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
vulnerable interaction with them again

58
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,318
it must have been really kind of a

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
no-brainer right or or did you guys have

60
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,919
some discussion and say gee could do

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,200
could we go back to start working again

62
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,280
together

63
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,759
i mean there was definitely something in

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,719
the air because without knowing

65
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,639
that

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,800
john wanted to come back and without

67
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,719
knowing that flea had

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
been having interactions with john

69
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,400
musically

70
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,079
suddenly i felt very overwhelmed with

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,680
the feeling of

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,920
how do we get john back

73
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
and i and flea and i had a very classic

74
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,958
moment where we went to each other

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,318
to say something important and he's like

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,479
i got to go and i was like no i got to

77
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,399
tell you something i got to and it was

78
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,560
just in the air it was time for john to

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,879
come back and i was shocked when flee

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,878
told me that that john was

81
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,878
interested and that he had been playing

82
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,318
with john and

83
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,239
you know there was there were no hard

84
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,719
feelings there were no resentments there

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,800
were no regrets the fact that we were

86
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,719
able to kind of keep things going while

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
john was away was sort of perfect in the

88
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,318
end because we were available when when

89
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,959
he showed up and

90
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,958
it was time for change
