00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
i want to go back to december 1991 and

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,359
paint for my audience the fact that when

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,280
blood sugar sex magic came out it was an

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,519
amazing time in music when you think

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,759
about it and to put it into

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,759
some kind of perspective

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,160
you guys were on the road with pearl jam

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,118
as the opening act nirvana was in the

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,679
middle

10
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,320
and you guys were the closers that is an

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,320
amazing moment in music i can't imagine

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,518
what that tour must have been like

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
you guys

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,799
had an album that was really breaking

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,558
big pearl jam was coming out with 10

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,479
and nirvana we know what what happened

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,039
with them what was that tour like back

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,078
then i remember just feeling like you

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,399
know they're good bands but nirvana

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,399
that they were really carrying a heavy

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,439
magic with them like just this feeling

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
like they

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,159
are a powerful entity to be respected

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,078
when we were playing together in

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,640
you know 88 89

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,558
like when we were still playing in clubs

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
it really felt like a life-or-death

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,280
thing that we we had to succeed at what

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,599
we were doing you know like like not

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680
just commercially but like our shows had

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,679
to have an energy our shows had to move

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,360
people people had to be dancing you know

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,080
like our styles were in large part

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,000
developed because we were under that we

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,079
put ourselves under that pressure of

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
wanting to be good oh that's good you

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,319
know who was good

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,879
nirvana they sure were when we played

39
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,959
with them yeah they were just good no

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,158
i mean that was a

41
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,599
life changer what do you mean anthony

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
what do you mean they were just good

43
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,959
like they

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
what was it you know i feel like some of

45
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,158
this is a natural thing like john has a

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,319
very clear understanding of dynamics and

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,399
then for me the that feeling that john

48
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,319
is so beautifully describing it was just

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320
natural the first time that we ever

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,719
played it was just natural to

51
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,438
have an energy to have a passion and

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,519
have a live or die

53
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,039
aesthetic to everything that we did

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,399
but i feel like nirvana had that

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,960
naturally as well like they were

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,040
certainly good at their instruments and

57
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,599
songwriting and chemistry and all that

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
but then they also just had a

59
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,719
combustibility that

60
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,719
that came with birth or came from god or

61
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,560
came from the planets or something did

62
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,239
you get to hang out with kurt cobain and

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,598
talk about being a front man i would

64
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
imagine you

65
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,000
being around

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
other front men so to speak uh would be

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,159
important

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,759
i mean i i was usually pretty nervous

69
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,520
when i whenever i was hanging around

70
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,159
with him um

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
just because i was in awe and

72
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,840
and he wasn't the type who wanted to

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,878
discuss being a front man he was just

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
kind of shy and in his energetic

75
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,318
state

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,519
but uh flea and i had some some nice

77
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,199
moments with him at a some mtv show

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
where we snuck away and went backstage

79
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,159
and just sat with him while he was

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
getting ready to play

81
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,199
and that was a nice experience um what

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,199
was unusual about it that uh that he was

83
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,000
sitting and playing and kind of loose as

84
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,158
a goose and like loose he was loose and

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,479
and warm and inviting and relaxed and it

86
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,318
wasn't like he had been on tour for a

87
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,479
long time and was all you know

88
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,598
emotionally chaotic he was quite within

89
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,359
himself and said yeah come and sit and

90
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
yeah um

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,159
he was a beautiful dude and he left us

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,840
with a ton of

93
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,840
unbelievable music and energy
