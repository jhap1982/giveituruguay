Notes: The Philadelphia show was recorded for LiveArchive to be freely accessible to all fans for their enjoyment and pleasure. I would also like to dedicate this show to all RHCP fans for their support and unlimited love of the band. Thank you to Leni, for all the hard work he puts into making this possible for all who love RHCP. I also want to acknowledge my longtime friend Anton, who still plays a part in having shows like this available. I do not want to forget to mention one of the biggest fans of RHCP; Henrik Lewandowski, who attended his 180th show in Philadelphia last evening! Last but not least, for one of my newest RHCP brothers, TJ Packard, for allowing me to ride ten hours in his car to make this possible. It has been an incredible journey with him the past few days!
