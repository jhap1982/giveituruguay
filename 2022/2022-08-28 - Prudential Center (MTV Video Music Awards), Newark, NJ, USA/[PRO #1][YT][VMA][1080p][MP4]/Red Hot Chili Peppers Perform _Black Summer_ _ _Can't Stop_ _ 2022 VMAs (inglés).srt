00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:14,780
- [Lyrics] A lazy rain am I,

2
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:19,085
The skies refuse to cry

3
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:24,790
Cremation takes its piece of your supply

4
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,001
The night was dressed like noon,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,604
A sailor spoke too soon

6
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:44,210
And China's on the dark side of the moon

7
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,990
Hit it now

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,428
Platypus are few,

9
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:06,299
the secret life of Roo

10
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:13,272
A personality I never knew,

11
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:15,207
Get it on

12
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:19,412
My Greta weighs a ton,

13
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,783
The archers on the run

14
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,954
And no one stands alone

15
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,855
Behind the sun

16
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:39,633
It's been a long time since I made a new friend

17
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:43,703
Waiting on another black summer to end

18
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,940
It's been a long time, and you never know when

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,843
Waiting on another

20
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,346
black summer to end

21
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:34,854
Crack the flaming whip,

22
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:39,558
a-sailing on a censorship

23
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:44,197
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip

24
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:53,039
It's been a long time since I made a new friend

25
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,343
Waiting on another black summer to end

26
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,448
It's been a long time, and you never know when

27
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:05,218
Waiting on another black summer to end

28
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,996
I've been waiting

29
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,198
I've been waiting

30
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,169
Waiting on another black summer to end

31
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,104
I've been waiting

32
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,073
I've been waiting

33
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,776
Waiting on another black summer to end

34
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,478
I've been waiting

35
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,647
I've been waiting

36
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:40,353
Waiting on another black summer to end

37
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,810
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig

38
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,380
Chop Top, he says I'm going to win big

39
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,849
Choose not a life of imitation

40
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,286
Distant cousin to the reservation

41
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,422
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for

42
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,358
This punk, the feeling that you stay for

43
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,593
In time I want to be your best friend

44
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,029
East side love is living on the West End

45
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,999
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to

46
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,302
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do

47
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,004
Go write your message on the pavement

48
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,407
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

49
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,409
White heat is screaming in the jungle

50
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,879
Complete the motion if you stumble

51
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,381
Go ask the dust for any answers

52
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,883
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

53
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,319
The world I love, the tears I drop

54
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,889
To be part of the wave, can't stop

55
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,259
Ever wonder if it's all for you

56
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,763
The world I love, the trains I hop

57
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,665
To be part of the wave, can't stop

58
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:11,204
Come and tell me when it's time to

59
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,774
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone

60
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,310
So smart, she's leading me to ozone

61
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,545
Music, the great communicator

62
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,981
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

63
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,085
I'll get you into penetration

64
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,820
The gender of a generation

65
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,756
The birth of every other nation

66
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,424
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

67
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,427
This chapter's gonna be a close one

68
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:38,031
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one

69
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,300
All on a spaceship, persevering

70
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,002
Use my hands for everything but steering

71
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,639
Can't stop the demons when they need you

72
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,174
Mop tops are happy when they feed you

73
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:50,442
J. Butterfly is in the treetop

74
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:53,379
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

75
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,415
The world I love, the tears I drop

76
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,818
To be part of the wave, can't stop

77
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:03,455
Ever wonder if it's all for you

78
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,158
The world I love, the trains I hop

79
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:09,062
To be part of the wave, can't stop

80
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,667
Come and tell me when it's time to

81
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:19,973
Wait a minute, I'm passing out, win or lose

82
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,675
Just like you

83
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:29,716
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew

84
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,287
How about you

85
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:40,060
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new

86
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,028
Just like you

87
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,601
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew

88
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,372
Right on cue

89
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,986
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig

90
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,490
Chop Top, he says I'm going to win big

91
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,891
Choose not a life of imitation

92
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,127
Distant cousin to the reservation

93
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,031
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for

94
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,300
This punk, the feeling that you stay for

95
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,935
In time I want to be your best friend

96
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,004
East side love is living on the West End

97
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,574
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to

98
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,144
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do

99
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,046
Go write your message on the pavement

100
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,749
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

101
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,418
Kick start the golden generator

102
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,254
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her

103
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,656
Can't stop the gods from engineering

104
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,392
Feel no need for any interfering

105
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,528
Your image in the dictionary

106
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,630
This life is more than ordinary

107
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,899
Can I get two, maybe even three of these

108
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,836
Coming from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

109
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,471
Can't stop the spirits when they need you

110
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:02,307
This life is more than just a read-through

111
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,943
[applause]
