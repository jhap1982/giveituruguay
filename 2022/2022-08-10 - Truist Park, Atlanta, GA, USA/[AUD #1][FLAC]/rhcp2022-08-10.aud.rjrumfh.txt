Notes: The last time I got see RHCP play a show was a little over 5 years ago. The last time I had actually recorded one of their shows was in 2012. The band was spot on and the return of John Frusciante makes them so much better. Anytime I record RHCP, it is done solely for all their fans to enjoy! A special thank you to RHCP Live Archive for being the inspiration to provide audio for fans from all over the world. There are two people I would like to dedicate this recording to; leandrorhcp and sika83, they both promote live music at its very best by RHCP.
