**Contrast Clause** 

This recording is different from the one uploaded here: http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=481225 
Since it was recorded from an internet stream whereas this video was recorded from an HDTV broadcast. 

This one also only features the RHCP performance as opposed to the other video which also features the rest of Bruno Mars' performance.
