Notes:
This is a combination of three rips: two from me and one from DIME user eva0001. eva's rip had the fewest glitches so it is used for the majority of the show. My sources were only used to patch some cuts in the first two songs and for The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie, Californication, and By The Way. The stream completely cut out in the middle of Snow and didn't resume until after Rain Dance Maggie had started so those two songs are incomplete. At 01:23:53 a Windows popup appears in the video, this was actually on the broadcast (someone plugged in an iPhone to the computer running the stream). Big thanks to eva0001.
