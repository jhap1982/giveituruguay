Show Me Your Soul
Notes

Lyp-synched performance for "Save the Planet", a TV special to draw attention about global pollution and over-population crisis. 
Some sources date it on April 20th, but that's actually the broadcast date.

This show has been broadcasted nationwide by CBS on April 20, 1990 and September 14, 1990. 
This Hard Rock Cafe Special also featured: Billy Joel, Quincy Jones, Bobcat Goldthwait, 
Katey Sagal featuring Sandra Bernhard, Taylor Dayne, M.C. Hammer, Rob Lowe and the voice of James Earl Jones. 
It has been recorded in March-April 1990 (not sure about the exact date). 
It's a cool performance but it's too bad they lip-synched the song ("Show Me Your Soul" has never been done live to my knowledge).
