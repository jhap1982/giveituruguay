This show aired Friday March 30,1990 featuring the Red Hot Chili Peppers high energy performance of the Stevie Wonder classic "Higher Ground" on Latenight with David Letterman.  Promoting their new album (at the time) Mother's Milk.

I think Letterman had a rule that you could play but that his band had to play WITH you.  This is why you see an out-of-place Will Lee singing backups etc.
