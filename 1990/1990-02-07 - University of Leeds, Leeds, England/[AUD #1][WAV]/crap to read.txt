I recorded this from the master tape used to record this. It was given to me by my best friend's father as a birthday present. 
I am aware that there is a copy of this tape somewhere but not in major circulation, hence me doing this. My friends father believes that he must have traded this tape breifly at one point and them making a copy of it.
Mommy where's Daddy? and Fire are encore songs.
