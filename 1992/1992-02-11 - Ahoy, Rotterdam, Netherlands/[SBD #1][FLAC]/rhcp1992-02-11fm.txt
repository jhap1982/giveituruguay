Disclaimer.
Please note that this is a real FM capture, no cable, but straight from the airwaves. Also, this comes from a tape that was more than 16 years old at the time of transferring. This means that some FM and/or tape anomalies or degeneration may be present. Most has been fixed to the best of my abilities and most of this stuff is of very good quality. MP3 samples will be provided upon request.

P.S. From what I can find, these songs were torrented on Dime before (November 5, 2005) as part of the liberated Live Storm bootleg double CD "Europe 1987/92" - http://theside.free.fr/bootography/offbootSetlist.php3?id=1988000003
