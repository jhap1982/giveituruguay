Ok, VIDEOMUSIC was an italian music channel with a good taste of music
lot's of great live gigs were aired,.....until the channel collapsed in debts

Ho, sure his frequency were grabbed by Italian version of MTV..
so now we hare full of pretty stupid gooo-d looking guys 
with lot's of nothing in the head....

This my VHS tape i recorded in 1990, best quality? hope yes, enjoy!2
