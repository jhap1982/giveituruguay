NOTES:
This is a rip from the liberated bootleg CD "Positive Magik - Black Magik" (Men At Work: WORK 5543.2 PHC). The CD and the booklet say "Recorded Live In Europe '92", and in fact this is an incomplete recording of the Milan show on March 1, 1992. I omitted three songs of the actual CD at the beginning; they were not RHCP tracks. The track numbers of the tracks 4-15 were renamed accordingly to their order to 1-12. There is another liberated bootleg featuring this show, "Funk Off", it has a slightly different track listing and is a little worse, quality wise. None of the both bootleg releases feature the complete Milan '92 recording though.
