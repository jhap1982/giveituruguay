comments:
 this is from a hard-funky era of the RHCP when "give it away"
was a big hit on the radio. It's a pretty good recording for
this venue (outdoor ampitheater) and event. the lower midrange 
gets a bit heavy (common for ampitheater shows and probably for 
auds of RHCP shows) but nothing saturates, nice job on the 
recording of this which came from Tim in Boston. I don't know 
if he recorded it (I think he did), I think this is from a 1st 
gen. cassette copy of the master cassette (both Maxell XLII 
recorded with no dolby). I think the album being featured here
was "blood sugar sex magic", one of their most popular. There's
a little feel of the Living Colour effect in here (Vernon Reid)
but with a little more edge. Lollapollooza was in 92 and 93 
probably the biggest "alternative" music tour of those 2 years.
this year's model also featuring Pearl Jam, (and several more)
and 93's was with Alice in Chains. I don't have those sets.
this is probably the "crudest" music I've ever listened to,
and the closest to rap music. etree lists this concert as August 7,
although the set sequence for that does not quite match this one.
maybe there were 2 shows on consecutive days? it's possible,
the next date listed there is Aug. 9 at Jones Beach in Wantaugh, N.Y. 
I don't know, think there was just one and the kind fellow who 
gave me this tape, also attended the concert, said it's Aug 8th.
Do not sell this recording.
Share freely, losslessly and gaplessly.
(and not too much salt with your peppers)
