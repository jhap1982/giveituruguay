The setlist remained almost the same for every show, with only a few additional jams and snippets added from time to time. 
The 90-minute, 16-track show was mainly focussed on “One Hot Minute”, the recent (and poor) sequel to “Blood Sugar Sex Magik” album, with 10 tracks played.
Usually three tracks from “Blood Sugar Sex Magik” were included in the setlist (“Give It Away”, “Suck My Kiss” and “Under The Bridge”), one from “Mother’s Milk” (“Higher Ground”) and two from “The Uplift Mofo Party Plan” (“Backwoods” and “Me And My Friends”).
“Come As You Are” (Nirvana) was played as a short intro to “Backwoods”, and likewise “Sound And Vision” (David Bowie) for “Higher Ground”.
One of the most notable change in the setlist happened in the Stockholm show, during which “Power Of Equality” was played as the last song of the main set, and “Me And My Friends” was played instead of “Suffragette City”.

@ THE COMMERCIAL BOOTLEGS OF THE AHOY SHOW
Fortunately for the fans, three of the sixteen European concerts were released in full by bootleggers on commercial unofficial releases:
- The Stockholm concert as “One Hot Globe” by Moonraker (using their connections with Swedish and German tapers),
- The Parisian show as “Coffee Shop” by Mountains (a local French label),
- Flea’s Birthday Party in Rotterdam was radio-broadcasted in full, and four different labels released their version of the concert:

- “Flea’s Birthday Gig” (Midnight Beat) is overall the best source and release, but is missing “Me And My Friends”, some dead air after this song, and part of the noise’s end after “Suffragette City”. There is a small sound drop after “Pea” (present on every source) that was easily corrected, and a small glitch during “Transcending” (again easily cleaned). “Transcending” is badly indexed, with the second half of the song included on the index of the next track “Pea”.

- “Flea’s Birthday Suit” (German unknown label) is very similar to “Flea’s Birthday Gig”. “Me And My Friends” is included, but the two tracks of the encore are missing (“Deep Kick” and “Suffragette City”). There is a blank spot of 6 seconds after “One Big Mob” (no music missing). 

- “Slap Happy” (Oxygen) has a more heavier sound, but unfortunately it was mixed like many KTS releases with fake crowd noises (6 seconds at the start of “Grand Pappy Du Plenty” and 13 seconds at the noise’s end after “Suffragette City”). Two tracks were omitted: “One Big Mob” after “Pea”, and “Me And My Friends” after “Under The Bridge”.

- “Hot Life” (Razor’s Edge) could have been the best release as it is a 2CD set. Unfortunately the sound is mono, and around 10 seconds of dead airs are missing between “One Big Mob” and “Under The Bridge”. Despite that, “Hot Life” is having additional seconds not found on any other source, especially between the main set and the encore, and at the noise’s end after “Suffragette City”.
