Another year, another volume of music memories. I have numerous DVDs of live performances recorded from TV that I have converted from my master VHS tapes. Instead of hoarding them, I figure there must be some stuff others would enjoy too. I started sporadically recording favorite or interesting bands in 1990 and only really got into the swing of it - checking TV guide, finding space on the tape, sitting ready with the remote late at night - in 1993.

**PLEASE READ THIS PARAGRAPH BEFORE DOWNLOADING** Even though these are sourced from my master VHS tapes, these recordings are far from perfect. For starters, the sound is in MONO until about 1999 when I got my first stereo VCR. Secondly, I had a plain old antenna which likely means some of the following: static, ghosts, fuzziness, jitters, drooling, heartburn, vampires. Thirdly, I often recorded in SLP mode to conserve tape, never imagining I'd be sharing them digitally 15 years later. Fourthly, songs are not guaranteed uncut, with no editing capability on tape I didn't want lengthy stretches between songs so some chops are inevitable. All in all, unless you're completely spoiled by digital and HD broadcasting, despite the previous points these are still for the most part very watchable and enjoyable, but consider yourself fairly warned.

Although the quality of this DVD overall doesn't seem as consistent as the previous volumes (1995 must've been a bad year for storm fronts sweeping through), there are many memorable highlights for me here: Michael Stipe getting away with "fuck" by turning his back to the camera in the days before 3-second delays, Green Day's emergence into the national spotlight, Lou Reed's amazing cover song, and most of all Primus' legendary appearance on Letterman dressed in penguin outfits!

I have spent considerable time researching dates and checking for officially released material. Using moderator Nightshifted's guidelines, each entry includes the artist, song title, TV show, and year at minimum, with most having uncovered a specific date. From my DVD I removed 4 songs due to their prohibited or questionable status. To the best of my knowledge, these remaining 31 performances have never been released or are scheduled for the near future. I hope those of you that take the plunge enjoy this DVD, furthermore you can marvel at my impeccable musical taste :-)  Any additional info or corrections (a couple song names are pure guesses) are encouraged.

One more minor note - these DVDs were my first VHS transfer projects. Before I learned a better method, I recorded these with 2 titles on each DVD. I don't have any text on the menu screen, just move your selector left or right to choose between the two titlesets. If you start with Title 1, it will play the disc straight through. On the plus side, chapter points mark the start of each performance.
