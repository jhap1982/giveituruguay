Red Hot Chili Peppers play their song "My Friends" off their album 'One Hot Minute' live on the Late Show with David Letterman. This aired on November 9, 1995.

As far as I am aware, this performance has never been officially released, and Letterman performances are automatically blocked for viewing on YouTube, meaning that torrents are necessary to distribute this performance between fans.

DVD resolution (704x480 interlaced, 29.97 fps)
Audio 44.1 kHz / 16 bit mono PCM restored from AC3 stream (hum removed, volume increased)
Subtitle track is included, from the original closed captions on the broadcast.

Lineage:
Cable TV broadcast // mono Toshiba VCR at SP speed // another mono Toshiba VCR at SP speed (2nd gen) // Panasonic DMR-E80H DVD burner at XP speed // lossless digital copy made with MakeMKV // this segment spliced from the DVD using MKVTooNix // audio restored using iZotope RX 10 Advanced // remuxed using MKVToolNix

The MKV file includes the original MPEG video stream; no re-encoding has been performed. The 2nd gen VHS video tape included several different unrelated performances recorded over a period of several months, which was recorded in its entirety to DVD before I received it. Therefore, doing this splicing was necessary for proper organization of the music content.
