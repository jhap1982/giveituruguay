NOTES:
This comes from the DVD that was recorded from the MHD broadcast, not the MTV one. MHD didn't air the complete set and the pace of the the broadcast was a bit slow. I'm assumung the order of the songs was slightly changed too. I fixed the pace problem by speeding up the WAV file, but there was no way for me to put the tracks into the right order as I couldn't find a proper setlist for this show. Nevertheless, this is the best we can get.
