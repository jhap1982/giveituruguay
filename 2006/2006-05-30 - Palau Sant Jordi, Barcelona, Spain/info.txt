Notes

Support: Dizzee Rascal


"Don't You Ever Leave" was played without vocals because Anthony knocked his head on Chad's drums towards the end of 
"Throw Away Your Television" and had to go backstage. 
They also supposedly soundchecked those songs: "Snow ((Hey Oh))", "So Much I", "The Zephyr Song", "Knock Me Down" 
(I highly doubt they really soundchecked this one) and "Strip My Mind".
