(#) - John Frusciante solo


Notes: Full show, broadcasted live by Mega FM. Sound quality is far from being perfect: it 
             is somewhat compressed, but that is how all the broadcasts from the 2006 edition 
             of the festival sounded. Still very listeanable IMO. The major advantage of these 
             broadcasts is that neither of them has the glitches that are present on TV sourced 
             audios... Again, IMO, this makes it worth the download.

             I removed all the station IDs I could (about 15 of them...) but there were four or five 
             that couldn't be cut because they were placed during the songs. I also removed DJ 
             comments during the encore break and smoothed track transitions using Adobe 
             Audition. Everything should flow just fine. Of course, in order to seamlessly join both
             discs simply remove tracks 12 and 13. Enjoy!
