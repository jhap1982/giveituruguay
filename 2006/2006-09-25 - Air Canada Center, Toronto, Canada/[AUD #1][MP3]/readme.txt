README

The original files were in .flac, I converted them out of flac so more people could play them.  I kept them at a fairly high kbps mp3, so the quality is still good.  I also added in the end of Wet Sand, which was missing from the original recording, from a different source.  London Calling/Right on Time is missing.  All other songs are present.
