Notes:

Located about 40 feet from right stack at 45 degrees.

Went mic in via attenuator rather than line in via battery box as I thought might not be loud enough for
the line in option.  

Minidisc change part way through Californication, hence fade out/fade in.
Cut some of encore break

Please listen to the mp3 sample before downloading.
