Notes
Exclusive free promo show for XFM radio, tickets had to be won from a contest.
Although broadcasted on various radio stations in late 2006, upon close inspection, the August 28, 2006 performance was the one actually aired. We believe the band mistakenly handed them the wrong master (or perhaps intentionally due to being unhappy with the real performance).
