## Notes

> Exclusive free promo show for XFM radio, tickets had to be won from a contest.
<br> Although broadcasted on various radio stations in late 2006, upon close inspection, the **August 28, 2006** performance was the one actually aired. We believe the band mistakenly handed them the wrong master (or perhaps intentionally due to being unhappy with the real performance).
