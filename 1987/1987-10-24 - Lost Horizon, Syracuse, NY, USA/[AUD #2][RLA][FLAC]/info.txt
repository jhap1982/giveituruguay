This show is from the collection of "Agmanp" who was active taping and collecting for several years in the late 80's/early 90's. He was gracious enough to lend some of his collection to Smores who is working to get many of the old shows transferred and uploaded for others to enjoy. Some of these shows are completely uncirculated while some of the circulated ones are getting a fresh transfer from the master tapes. 
PLEASE contact Smores on DIME if you have any Biohazard, Hellyeah, Sworn Enemy, Hatebreed, Suburban Scum or Criminal Instinct.
