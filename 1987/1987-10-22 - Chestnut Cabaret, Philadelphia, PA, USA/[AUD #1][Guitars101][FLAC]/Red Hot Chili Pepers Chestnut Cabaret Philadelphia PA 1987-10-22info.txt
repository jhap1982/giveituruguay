Notes:
very low levels first 22 seconds 
master cassette flip appeared to happen because the taper probably didn’t realize the song wasn’t over even though it seemed like it. 
This is essentially a straight raw transfer of the cassette master. Nothing other than tracking was done to digital file. No use raising the first 22 seconds as that would just make the hiss loud and preserving the entire recording matters more than cosmetic edits. There was nothing to be done with the cassette flip cut. No patch available and no blend or crossfade was going to help.
