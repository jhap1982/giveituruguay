This one's dedicated to sika83.  Its due to his persistence that I searched, located, digitized and uploaded this one.  I'm not really a fan of this band. The only reason I grabbed this one when I did in the late 80's was to hear the Vandals show.
Both shows are very rough audience recordings.  At this point I have no intention to upload the Vandals show.  The only thing it has going for it is having Stevo the original singer still in the band, but the recording is rougher than the Chili Peppers show. It would be a completest-only upload and I have some cool other things I think are more upload able.

Anyway, this one's for you, sika83.
