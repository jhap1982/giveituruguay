Nice quality, and one of the few "good quality" shows with Navarro...Torrent includes high-resolution scans (art and CD+Ticket/flyer).If you have an alternate or more complete version/upgrade please share!!!

Request:

I'm looking for the "From San Francisco With Rum" CD rip, it was seeded a while ago, but I missed it, as I can remember, sound was great!
