The "Gravity" bootleg CD on the Oxygen label contains the entire show, recorded from a Triple J (live?) broadcast. Unlike the other FM source ("Gangway" bootleg) this one features 'Spiritual' and 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'. The boradcast included some more or less annoying "Tripple J" yelling every now and then as well.
