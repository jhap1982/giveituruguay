This appearance has been misdated until today as Jan 24th 1997. This discussion from 1996 mentions the band playing in fur jackets just three months after their last appearance where Chad Smith played with his arm in a cast.

There's no mention or any media of the band playing on Letterman's in 1997 to be found.

Notes
The band dressed in fur coats as a joke to the fact that Letterman would always have the studio temperature as low as 55°F/13°C.
This performance has been widely and wrongly misdated as Jan 24th 1997. There was no performance at Letterman's show during that year since no mention or media has been found.
