1. Aeroplane

## Notes

> The band dressed in fur coats as a joke to the fact that Letterman would always have the studio temperature as low as 55°F/13°C.
This performance has been widely and wrongly misdated as **Jan 24th 1997**. There was no performance at Letterman's show during that year since no mention or media has been found.
