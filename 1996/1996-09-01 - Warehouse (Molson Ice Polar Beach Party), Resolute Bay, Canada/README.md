## Notes

> Molson's beer brand planned to send 70 people on a four-day trip cruising the Arctic Sea from Resolute Bay in an icebraker called "Kapitan Dranitsyn" and the band was supposed to play a show aboard the ship one afternoon. The trip was cancelled at last minute due to bad weather and they held the performance in a local warehouse.

**Support**: Violent Femmes
