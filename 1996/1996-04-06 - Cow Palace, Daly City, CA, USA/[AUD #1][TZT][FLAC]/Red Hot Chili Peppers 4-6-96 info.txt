Here is another of my master tapes for your enjoyment.

What can you say about the 96 tour of the Peppers with Navarro except "WOW!"?

This is the source that was used for the Cherry Records release 'From San Francisco with Rum' The title came from Keidis being struck in the forehead by a fan-thrown bottle of Baccardi during Give It Away, prompting the rest of the band to play Bedhind the Sun while they waited to see if Keidis was alright to finish the show. Of course Anthony's priceless response to the action was "I love you" and the show went on.

I have included the weird opening/blessing to the show and the Toadies opening set to fill out the 2 CDs, unfortunately I have no idea what songs the Toadies played outside of the one tune listed. 
(I did not record the first opening act Weapons of Choice as we arrived late for their act)
I taped this while holding on to the front gate for dear life directly under Flea, so the sound is very crisp and upfront, an overall terrific recording. I would put this one up near the top with any of my other recordings.
I have included the ticket scan. Enjoy!
