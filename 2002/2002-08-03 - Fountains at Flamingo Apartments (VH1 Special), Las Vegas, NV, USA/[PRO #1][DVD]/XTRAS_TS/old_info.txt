BACKYARD BBQ WITH THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
    Monday, September 2, 8:00-9:00 p.m. ET/PT


    VH1 goes to Las Vegas where the Red Hot Chili Peppers play a private
concert for the winner of our 2002 Backyard BBQ sweepstakes.  Lucky winner
Leslie Prekop invited 50 of her friends to a personal concert in her own
backyard with "The Peppers." With the help of Volkswagen, Quizno's Subs and
Sam Adams, VH1 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers take over her apartment complex's
pool area and transform it into a rockin' concert venue. Out of 90,000 entries
one grand prize winner was chosen.  Other prizes included a Volkswagon Jetta
GLI, a grill, and $3,000 cash.
