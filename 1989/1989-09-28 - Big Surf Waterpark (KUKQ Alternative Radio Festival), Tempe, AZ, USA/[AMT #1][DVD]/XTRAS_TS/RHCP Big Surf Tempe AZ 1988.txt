 I got this many years ago from a friend who had connections to some promoters in the Phoenix area. Looks like it was (pro?) shot from the tower in the middle of the venue, single camera, above the crowd, shaky at times, lots of zooms, good quality video and sound though. Rare early footage of the young Chili peppers, with Hillel Slovak on guitar, I believe...

 Big Surf is a water park in Tempe, they used to have shows there back in the eighties. I remember the city of Snottsdale had a curfew at 9 pm and they would not allow loud music. You can hear the band keep saying "turn it up" for the first few songs. Pretty wild show, I believe this was the last concert they ever had a Big Surf, we were all ragin' hard, Chili Peppers were way fun back in the day.

 Not real sure on the date, most of the songs were from "Uplift Mofo Party Plan" with only one from "Mothers Milk", my guess is about 1988-89 or so, if anyone has more info Please post it... Unsure of song titles with (?)

R.I.P. - Hillel Slovak
