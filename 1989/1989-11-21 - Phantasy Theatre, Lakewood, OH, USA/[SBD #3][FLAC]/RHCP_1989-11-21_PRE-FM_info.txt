NOTES:
This comes straight from a Westwood One pre-FM master reel (High Voltage, Show #91-06, Reel #1) which also featured a set by Suicidal Tendencies (not included here). The broadcast was to be aired the week of February 4th 1991. It doesn't feature the complete concert though, just a couple of songs were included, along with some spoken words about the RHCP by Anthony. Any commercials, which initially were on the reel as well have been entirely removed. Scans of the broadcast's cue sheet are also included. There are other sources from the same performance which feature tracks not included here and vise versa, all being post-FM recordings.
