notes:I don't see this listed on a couple RHCP collector sites, so I'm guessing this is rare and was only in the hands of a few collectors before it got here. Video quality is really good, but the audio could be better. My DVD recorder stopped recording after about an hour, so I had to edit in the last song, Crosstown Traffic. Btw,this is the infamous gig, where a female GMU student accused the band of sexual battery/assualt after the gig. Apparently, Anthony Keidis whipped out his penis in front of the girl and she was none too pleased and filed a lawsuit.
