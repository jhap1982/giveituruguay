Here’s a digital SBD master with no analog gens behind it at all, recorded onto a digital Beta recorded straight to PCM, then tracked and flac’d…though not by me…

I would have tracked it a bit differently, but still, who cares…look at this setlist…

Sure, they are weak now, but there was a time, when they could really stir things up…

And this is from that time…

Completely uncirculated, as far as I can tell…The Otherside RHCP database incorrectly lists this one as being from the Tower Theatre, the Chestnut is the correct info, as a couple of reviews for this have come to light verifying it. RHCP were not quite Tower ready, they were still playing clubs for John’s first tour…it wouldn’t be long before…nevermind, I’d rather not talk about it…

Enjoy, but please:
