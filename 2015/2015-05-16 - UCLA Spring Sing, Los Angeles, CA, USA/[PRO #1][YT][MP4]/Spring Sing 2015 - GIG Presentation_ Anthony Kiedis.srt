on before I get carried away here

78
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,439
sidetracked into a surreal day dream

79
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,468
I would like to say that this is really

80
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,788
on behalf from the Red Hot Chili Peppers

81
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:40,278

00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:44,808
and that's my band in those are my brothers in

85
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:55,039
I'm I went to school here every year in nineteen eighty

86
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,819
the

87
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,810
the single me out the man who really this enough whatever this is

88
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,269
accomplishment through this work in progress or whatever you wanna call it

it's from a band I am one of whom is

90
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,350
with me tonight

91
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,290

92
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,080
receiving a lifetime achievement awards

93
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,639
quite dangerous and potentially

94
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,779
detrimental to your career because

95
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,799
I don't want to be done at all and I don't want to be

96
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,970
the

97
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,500
and i wanna be

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,720
irrelevant or disconnected for a from the things then

99
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,210
inspired me to begin with his in North

100
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:59,668
it happens to and poets and popular song writers you know the start of them have

101
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:03,818
such a great connection live and what it is to be

102
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:08,060
connected to humanity in the common experience and then we

103
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,889
we get successful in reaction you know the words that are coming in suddenly

104
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:12,259
have

105
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,610
really nothing thank live in fear that a little bit no

106
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,129
trying to figure out how to stave that off for as long as possible

107
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:26,360
but I am grateful nonetheless and I'm grateful for the experience

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,038
what it is to be

109
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,788
in those pointed out for someone who writes songs because that's what I love

110
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,069
to do in

111
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,240
I don't know in Georgian I really think about this tonight

112
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,979
but I get the back relate to one of the 2i would relate to ira

113
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,050
because he was the lyricist in

114
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:50,500
you know when I was a kid I really did love

115
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,909
words I loved the look upward sound

116
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,009
word the meaning of words that were Jinnah words

117
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,389
the inherent rhythm in million word seem to come within

118
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:05,610
the innuendoes like my dad was in the words he taught me about where the

119
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,778
word and when I was

120
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,958
12 I think I I proclaimed in I'm

121
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,068
I'm going to be a singer when I grow up and the

122
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:20,028
the weird part about that is I was a horrible singer

123
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:23,838
and I really had no musical Aki min

124
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,649
word town or anything at all but I like the way that music made me feel and

125
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,278
that's why I said that I didn't think

126
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,129
who is this great singer when I would listen to the radio

127
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:39,068
and I was your music fill me up so strong

128
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:42,939
me feel so alive and so turned on and excited

129
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,050
love ideas that even at a very young age

130
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:50,539
I knew okayed let me just be involved in this somehow and then it turned out I

131
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:51,578
had no Middletown

132
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:54,669
but quietly along the way

133
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:58,068
I love my very best friends world which

134
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:02,278
ending on the instruments and learning about music in practicing every day

135
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:03,759
and

136
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,539
and i was just around them long enough so that one day they like keeping your

137
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,278
words

138
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,399
to use over their income make a song with

139
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,539
in that that kinda how it panned out for me and then I got to learn a little bit

140
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,620
about music along the way really I just got lucky

141
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,220
I got lucky by being in the right place at the right time with my friends

142
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,230
and watching their work ethic in their dedication

143
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,670
and this whenever I had to offer seem to blend with that

144
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:36,409
that was my experience and I

145
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:39,870
very grateful and very appreciated that anybody cares and I

146
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,419
and I hope did last for a long time right now

147
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:49,159
right now we're in the middle writing a bunch of new music to make another

148
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,009
record

149
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:56,000
the wanna

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,438
Miami you know my George is called sleepy

151
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:03,478
and

152
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,669
he shattered his elbow so we've

153
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:10,058
we've sorted in in on the hiatus and that's why we're doing things like this

154
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:16,028
thing things happen for a reason and and now I'm just gonna shut up and we're

155
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:17,828
gonna play a couple the songs and just thank you
