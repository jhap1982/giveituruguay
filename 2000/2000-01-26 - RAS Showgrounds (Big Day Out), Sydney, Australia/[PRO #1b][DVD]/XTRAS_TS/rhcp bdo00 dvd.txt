this is the complete show minus the crowd problems before
scar tissue. the band stopped playing for about 10 minutes
so everyone could take a step back to avoid any mishaps when
part of the crowd fell over.

this dvd also includes 'i like dirt' which had not been included
in the original or any other broadcasts until last year.

a fruscisgod dvd  trade dont sell

enjoy :-)
