ohn sang an extended version of "Your Song". They also teased "Five Years" by David Bowie (Anthony actually fucked it up) and "Ramble On" by Led Zeppelin. Just before "Me And My Friends", they started playing the intro of "The Greeting Song" but then stopped! (Anthony hates this song so they never do it live).
