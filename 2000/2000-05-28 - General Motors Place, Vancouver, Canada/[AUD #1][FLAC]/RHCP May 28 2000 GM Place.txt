Red Hot Chili Peppers
Live in Vancouver
May 28, 2000
G.M. Place

Recorded on my re-refurbished (now deceaced) Sony WM D3 using a Sony ecm DS 70P mic in my hat.
Sat at the rear on the building about 15 rows up from the floor in the center line of the building. Sat above the entrance to a tunnel below the stands, so there's not anyone in front of my seat (kinda row 1)...
Tape xfer using Denon DRM 500 thru Sentrek analog EQ for extra warmth into Soundblaster card/PC/Wavelab 4.0/various mastering tools I've used sparingly, but extensive knowledge of use INTO hsrddrive as .wav files. 
Converted to FLAC using Traders little helper.

Notes on the show...
Foo Fighters opened the show, and Dave Grohl blew me away. He did a walkabout the auditorium during an extended solo, and popped up right in front of me! Also a wonderful tape.
After the Chilis were going for a while, there seemed to be way too much security people near me, and a bit of paranoia kicked in. In all my confusion, I droped the Foo Fighters tape behind my seat. 
I think now when I changed tapes, I put it under my leg on my seat (sitting on it for a bit) then forgot about it when I stood up for a sec to let someone thru. Once I flipped to side 2 for the Chili's, fishing around to get a third tape out, I realized the first tape (with Foo Fighters on it) was missing! Oh no. 
You can hear me asking for help to find it... It'd slid off my chair and onto the stepped up floor of the person sitting directly behind me. Eventually, noticing my panic, he tapped my shoulder and said those magic words "Is this yours?"
Anthony's back was killing him, so he wasn't his usual bouncy self. "I'm pissed off because I can't pogo!"
The Chili's tape flip kinds scared me, too! I was watching the second side start almost get eaten by my deck, rolling off the heads during the show. 
Cassette tape alignment's always been a big issue with me. Ever hear warbly multi-gen tapes? Hear alignment from deck to deck NEVER matches, and decks slip around everytime the transport engages/disengages. I have to re align my playback tapedeck for every tape I ReMaster.
