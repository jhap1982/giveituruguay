Notes:  Great sounding show from the peppers.  I tried to give the info about this show to stonecoldbush.com but the submit info link gives me some kind of error.  They don't have any info for this show on the website. Hope they see this on here.  I have several other shows that are not listed on stonecoldbush.com.
