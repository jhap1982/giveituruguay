Red Hot Chili Peppers' last show with D.H. Peligro on drums, November 26, 1988, Long Beach. Most of the show was filmed by Richard Alan White (https://www.youtube.com/@WorldRockumentaryChannel) & Louis Elovitz, there are at least three different edits of the video. Here's a rare one, previously unreleased on Youtube. Don't know exactly where it came from, I obtained it many years ago. 

A unique video of the band playing "Taste the Pain" & "Punk Rock Classic" which were rarely performed live, of John playing "Fight Like a Brave" which didn't last long. Sadly the tape is incomplete - everything is missing after "Mommy Where's Daddy". But the quality of the audio is pretty good. 

The video was remastered by me on April 28, 2023. 

Some fragments of it were shown on cable TV in late 1988.

Band: Anthony Kiedis - vocals; Michael Balzary (Flea) - bass, vocals; John Frusicante - guitar, vocals; Darren Henley (D.H. Peligro) - drums, vocals
