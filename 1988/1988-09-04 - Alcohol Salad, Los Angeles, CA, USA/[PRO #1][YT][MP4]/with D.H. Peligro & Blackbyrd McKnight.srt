8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,320
the issue of uh of music and grief over

the death of a very close friend that we

00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,239
know we've got a friend who died he

wasn't just a guitar player who was one

00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,239
of our best friends in the world and we

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
all have to deal with the grief of him

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,238
dying and it's a very difficult thing to

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,439
do but as far as our music it's like

17
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,179
that's the only way we're going to keep

18
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,979
living is by playing music and we're not

19
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,600
dead you know we're still alive and uh

20
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,089
the way to keep alive is for us to keep

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,158
playing and that's what we're gonna do
