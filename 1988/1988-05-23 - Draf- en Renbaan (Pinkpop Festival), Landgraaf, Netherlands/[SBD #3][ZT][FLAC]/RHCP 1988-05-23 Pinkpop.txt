Compilation of two partial radio recordings (tracks 01-08 and tracks 09-12), recorded at the massive Pinkpop festival. I'm not sure what the original song order is, but Crosstown traffic sounds like the last song or an encore.

Help with the setlist is appreciated!

Acts on the bill that day, in order of appearance: Rainbirds, The Godfathers, Aswad, Herman Brood & His Wild Romance, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Pogues, The Christians, Sinead O'Connor, Joe Cocker. 


Lineage tracks 01-08: FM (master) > Audacity (wav, normalize, track splitting) > xACT (flac) > you 
Likely lineage tracks 09-12: TV (mono, master) > Audacity (wav, normalize, track splitting) > xACT (flac) > you 


I'm digitizing my tape collection, mostly recorded from Dutch radio in the 80s and early 90s. The original tapes will be binned and after seeding I will not keep the original flac sets, so unfortunately I will not be able to reseed them in the future. 

Enjoy,
