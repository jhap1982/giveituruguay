25 years old and tonight's summer rock

is dedicated to him

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
how do you warm up for a gig like this

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,719
it's quite difficult

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,239
than clubs he gets into some serious

27
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,840
scales that spits sticks taught him when

28
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,039
he used to play in the band fear

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,280
jack you can usually find doing a

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
paradiddle on a table i i just

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,680
i psyched myself into a mental state of

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
delirium i go for the delirium mode of

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
concentration

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,438
