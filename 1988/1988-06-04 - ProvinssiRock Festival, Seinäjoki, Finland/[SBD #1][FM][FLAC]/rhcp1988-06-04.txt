1988-06-04 - Seinäjoki, Finland - Provinssi Rockfest '88

Source: FM
Conversion: CD-R>dBpowerAMP>FLAC

Note: Show is incomplete. Most of the songs are
cut in one way or another. There are some DJ talk 
and a few songs are missing. I don't know if this 
is the full FM broadcast or not, but it's the only 
version I've ever seen. The television broadcast
also has a few songs missing, but contains a few 
songs that the FM broadcast is missing. But the same 
thing goes with the FM broadcast, it contains a few
songs that the television broadcast is missing.

But, I would still definetly get this one. The show is
great with a real good live feel!

Enjoy!
