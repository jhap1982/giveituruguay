Setlist could be incomplete and not in the right order.

This was a festival and the Ramones were headlining. They were just starting their set and the Peppers came out on stage naked and danced around them while they were playing "Blitzkrieg Bop". That's how the Chili's wanted to show their appreciation to them but the Ramones were furious. By the way, I have two setlists for the Peppers show: the first one is from the finnish radio broadcast and the second one from the audience recording. I don't know what the right setlist is. This was Hillel's last show.

Special thanks to Freaky for sending me the pics.
