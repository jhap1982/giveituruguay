*This upload is Dedicated To & was created In Loving Memory of Pooh Murenko (d. 2023-04-18)*

Pooh was right here riding shotgun with me when this DVD was being produced in December 2014. 
Those were the good times, as were all the times that we had with him.
Best friend, life companion & soul mate, Pooh was a hero to both of us, he single-handedly made our lives great.
We think of him often, miss him every day & we'll never forget him.
