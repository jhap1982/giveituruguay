NOTES:
Rip of liberated bootleg "Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts" (Masudaya, MASU-12). This is one of Frusciante's first shows in the RHCP. D.H. Peligro, who was the band's drummer at that time, sang "I'm In The Mood For Love" [Sinatra]. "Stone Cold Bush" and "Subway To Venus" were still in the works.

Since the bootleg's artwork says "Live October 9, 1988" this recording was assumed to be from a performance at Octoke Gym, Olumbus, OH for many years. There is a video on youtube of the October 8th 1988 show, which is clearly the same performance as found on the "Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts" CD.
