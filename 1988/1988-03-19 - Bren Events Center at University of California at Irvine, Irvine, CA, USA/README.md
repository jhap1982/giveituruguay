## Notes

> Special appearance at the Vision Pro Skate Escape Pro Eliminations.
This performance has been misdated as September 20, 1987 for ages. It originally came from [The Side](https://www.rhcplivearchive.com/show/theside.free.fr/tour/tourSetlist.php3?id=198709200000)), 
where they mention that "after some research, it seems this is eventually the exact date of this show", meaning the actual date was never known in the first place as the [Red Hot Skate Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Skate_Rock) video release makes no mention of it.
The ticket scan, plus the band haircuts and tattoos confirm that March 19, 1988 is the correct date.
