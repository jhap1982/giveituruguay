A historical photo taken on May 23-24, 1988. Anthony showing his brand new partially unfinished bird tattoo by Henk Schiffmacher after band's first Pinkpop. AK also did a left shoulder tattoo with Chief Joseph on May 22-23. Flea did a tattoo "FLEA" on his shaved head and a bird tattoo on his right arm (that was later washed by little Clara in "Funky Monks" movie). Jack Irons did a white tiger on his right hand. Hillel did nothing - he never had any tattoos. One of the very few photos with AK's bird tattoo & Hillel Slovak. That was a weird time, just a month before Slovak passed away.
Don't know who is the author, but thanks to Pauline Mcgee for sharing this gem with me in such a superb quality.
UPD: itâ€™s May 25, 1988, Paris
