Notes: This is not one of my best efforts in recording a show. I guess one can say, “you can’t win them all”! For those of you who care to grab it, enjoy it in any way. A little bit about this experience. We had to arrive in Fargo a few days prior to the show due to a blizzard warning. There was a forecast of anywhere from 9 - 15 inches of snow, and winds up to 40 - 50 mph. The snow did fall, the wind was brutal at times, but it cleared just in time to make many of the roads safely passable to the Fargodome. I upgraded to the pit about 6 hours before the show. There’s nothing like being up close to see these guys perform. It was a fantastic show! I would like to dedicate this show to my wife who accompanied me on this journey! The audio was created for RHCP LiveArchive and all fans seeking a delicious musical entrée from the band.
