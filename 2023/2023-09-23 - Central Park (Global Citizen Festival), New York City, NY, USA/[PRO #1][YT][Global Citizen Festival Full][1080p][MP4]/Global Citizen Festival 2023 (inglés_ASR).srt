[Applause]

72
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:09,240
I am Juan Gary I'm Katie I'm Brianna I

73
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,100
am Sabrina and I am a global citizen

74
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,220
speaking to you today not as an actor

75
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,720
but as a global citizen just like you

76
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,419
I've been thinking a lot about what that

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,419
really means to be a global citizen

78
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:24,120
being a global citizen for me is about

79
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,939
empowering the voices around me giving

80
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,220
those who feel voiceless an opportunity

81
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,620
to express themselves and advocate for

82
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,780
the issues most important to them I'm a

83
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,819
global citizen because I believe in the

84
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,638
power of people and Collective Strength

85
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:42,479
because the forests in Canada and

86
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,240
Ecuador Brazil and America deserve to be

87
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,478
protected because girls in Afghanistan

88
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,500
Iran deserve access to an education

89
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:55,019
because kids and Rwanda Somalia and the

90
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,879
Pacific deserve to not be faced with

91
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,579
hunger every day

92
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,219
Global citizen is proof that no matter

93
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,318
who you are or where you're from you can

94
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,319
take meaningful action on the world's

95
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,500
biggest challenges together we can end

96
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,620
extreme poverty in our lifetime together

to learn and become whoever they want to

198
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,799
be because they don't have access to

want you to give the audience an

287
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,040
alternative that are better for our

288
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,778
planet

289
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,319

292
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,980
um time showers one song Max

293
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,078
but let me do one bill fossil fuels

294
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,300
fossil fuels well there are several

295
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,758
alternatives to fossil fuels I mean you

296
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:57,359
have solar energy wind energy hydropower

297
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,149
geothermal energy biomass energy I mean

298
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,539
I could go on and on

299
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,939
[Applause]

300
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,399
so many Alternatives why are water

301
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:10,759
leaders still deliberately passing laws

302
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:14,400
that subsidize and expand fossil fuels

303
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:16,558
good question fossil fuels pose a grave

304
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
threat to our planet burning them

305
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,279
releases carbon dioxide and other

306
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,558
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere

307
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,678
which act like a heat trapping blanket

308
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,959
which drives global warming it is a

309
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,840
recipe for a disaster for both our

310
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,720
environment and our health

311
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,939
precisely in Paris on the global citizen

312
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,620
power our planet stage I joined my

313
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,960
fellow Advocates calling on world

314
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,178
leaders to commit to climate financing

315
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,519
and to sign up fossil fuel treaty

316
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,919
against the destruction of nature but

317
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,319
we're still waiting for Action we must

318
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,660
urge world leaders to sign on to a new

319
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,119
fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty

320
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,160
which would ensure a just an equitable

321
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,159
transition away from fossil fuels

322
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,699
I've been advocating for this for a long

323
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,759
time the scientific fact

324
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,120
the scientific fact is that fossil fuels

325
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,500
account for a staggering 86 percent of

326
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,719
carbon emissions

327
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,538
but there's also a moral side to this

328
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,360
conversation we have to protect our

329
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:23,640
planet for all of us

330
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,759
just last week

331
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,280
one week ago we had the largest climate

332
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:33,859
March in four years with over 75 000

333
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,859
people and we had one sole demand

334
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,740
and fossil fuels thank you all very much

335
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,740
stay warm out there

336
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,798

[Applause]

338
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:57,859
we love that song Carry On and fossil

339
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,860
fuel

340
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,220
our beautiful planet

341
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,879
since this time last year there's been

342
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,279
more evidence than we ever needed that

343
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,179
our planet needs Urgent Care

344
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,558
we must act today to save our tomorrow

345
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,660
we're calling on private sector

346
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,819
companies to cut emissions in line with

347
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,298
science-based targets that means

348
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:32,759
reaching Net Zero by 2050.

349
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:35,460
invest in low-income and climate

350
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,859
affected countries because people on the

351
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,779
Forefront of climate change are the ones

352
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:41,579
that have contributed the least to it

353
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,980
and have the most to gain from

354
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,500
investment in its Solutions we need

355
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,779
projects that really deliver viable

356
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,179
options for clean energy like solar

357
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:53,700
panels and wind farms and help for

358
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:57,480
smallholder Farmers to adapt and survive

359
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,058
for the first time in 25 years extreme

360
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,880
wealth and extreme poverty have sharply

361
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:05,339
increased simultaneously people live in

362
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,679
an extreme poverty cannot afford to

363
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,240
invest in climate action for a crisis

364
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,298
they did not create

365
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,700
so we are calling for ambitious

366
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:18,179
solutions to Urgent and devastating

367
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,000
problems we have one planet we share one

368
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,580

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,460

stigmatized every single day

period poverty is the lack of menstrual

520
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:16,200
education and access to period products

521
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,558
no access to products can mean missing

522
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,798

we are all in this together and today

597
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,439
I'm thrilled to be here with my friend

598
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:06,000
Sophia

599
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,639
to call for action on women's

600
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,500
empowerment around the world

601
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,200
for countless women and girls around the

602
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,659
world empowerment starts with economic

603
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,118
independence as an advisor and an

604
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,460
investor in women-led businesses I know

605
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,500
firsthand that women-owned businesses

606
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,019
are growing two times faster than the

607
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,019
national average and women of color are

608
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:32,460
driving that exponential growth

609
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:34,619
but right now women only receive 16 of

610
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,418
conventional business loans which is

611
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,240
just over four percent of the total

612
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:42,059
funding allocated Financial equality

613
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,098
enables women to break free from poverty

614
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:46,858
setting off transformative Ripple

615
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:50,099
effects that posit positively impact

616
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:51,960
every corner of society this empowerment

617
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,179
translates to increased educational

618
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,460
opportunities for children

619
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,039
better health care for families and

620
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,720
thriving communities if women and men

621
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,960
around the world participated on equal

622
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:07,079
footing the global economy could grow by

623
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,659
an astonishing two and a half trillion

624
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,279
dollars so investing in women-led

625
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,980
businesses will not only increase

626
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,720
economic independence but it's also a

627
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,139
good business decision

628
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:21,598
so let's keep raising our voices because

629
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:24,179
gender equality isn't a women's issue

630
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,760
it's a human issue

631
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:29,699
thank you thanks

632
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:33,680

million girls worldwide are denied the

636
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:46,439
basic right of access to education and

637
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:50,159
girls are more likely to live in extreme

638
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:52,380
poverty it's time we all do more to

639
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,618

say

682
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,760
no one sees the world quite like an

683

684
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,040

Net Zero goals and part of the way we're

artisan-made amenity kits on board

723
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:58,740
to date we have eliminated about 4.9

724
00:39:55,338 --> 00:40:00,659
million pounds of single-use plastics on

725
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:02,459
our planes

726
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:05,399
that's right

727
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,280
25 of our ground service equipment is

728
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,338
fully electrified and we have saved more

729
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,920
than 10 million gallons of fuel thanks

International Development Norway

740
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,519
we must all tackle the global food

741
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,739
crisis together

742
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,400
so I'm thrilled to announce that Norway

743
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:04,799
is pledging 90 million dollars to the

744
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,329
international fund for agricultural

745
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,740

[Applause]

747
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:13,199
you know Africa has abundant human and

748
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,838
natural resources

749
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:19,319
but its countries continue to import

750
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:22,559
food for billions of dollars every year

751
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,920
because its farmers are lacking access

752
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,078
to the resources that they need

753
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,200
now Norway's pledge will help

754
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,320
small-scale farmers in Africa get the

755
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:37,460
tools and technologies that they need to

756
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,559
adapt to climate change

757
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,838

Africa where yes where not only is there

1245
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:25,020
an issue of Access to Health Services

1246
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:27,000
to many but there's often stigma and

1247
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:30,120
discrimination connected to these

1248
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,819
Services especially for young people and

1249
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:35,179

Charlize Theron Africa Outreach project

1254
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,940
but this isn't just a South African

1255
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:51,299
issue

1256
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:55,259
it's a global one around the world an

1257
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:58,440
estimated 4.3 billion people of

1258
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:01,980

1259
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:03,960

lifetime

1262
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:11,340
and oftentimes as young people we don't

1263
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:13,859
even have the information we need when I

1264
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:16,219
was just 15 I realized that my school's

1265
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:18,719
sex ed curriculum in Tucson Arizona

1266
01:18:16,219 --> 01:18:20,939
hadn't been updated in decades I'm

1267
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:23,100
talking since the 80s and it wasn't

1268
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:25,439
medically accurate didn't even mention

1269
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:28,560
consent so when I worked with committed

1270
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:30,839
citizens just like you all to rewrite it

1271
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:33,300

1272
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,159

01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:15,719
against Global hunger inequality and the

1328
01:21:12,779 --> 01:21:18,599
climate crisis which is why we all join

1329
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:21,840
together in asking Congress to not cut

1330
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:24,000
foreign aid budget in 2024. after we

1331
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,039
rose up and pasted posters all across

1332
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,420
New York City we targeted our

1333

Representatives

1334
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,039
we reminded our leaders that they cannot

1335
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:34,198
turn their backs on today's Global

1336
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:36,300
challenges that women and girls around

1337
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:39,238
the world are the first to face the

1338
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:41,340
impacts of the climate crisis hunger and

1339
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:44,359
poverty and we need to stand up together

1340
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:45,300
because issues are all interconnected

01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:53,399
and that the U.S must uplift Global

1344
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,679
Frontline communities affected first and

1345
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:58,259
worse by the climate crisis and are

1346
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,420
continuing to be affected today we must

1347
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,579
seize this moment to become a Beacon of

1348
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:05,100
Hope for the future because we called

1349
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:06,719
out Congress and we came together and

1350
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,820
they're taking action but Congress has

1351
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,619
now responded but much more action is

1352
01:22:08,819 --> 01:22:12,269
needed

1353
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:32,640

1355
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,820

1357
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:40,380
everything we can to ensure our country

1358
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,840

remain committed to fighting for foreign

leadership and know that I'm in Congress

1366
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:05,899
doing the same

1367
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:14,639
just last month I visited a refugee camp

1368
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,880
in Kenya where a quarter million

1369
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:19,920
refugees are struggling with hunger and

1370
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:24,060
elsewhere in Kenya I visited a factory

1371
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:26,100
making plumpy nuts called rutf for

1372
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:29,699
children who are suffering from severe

1373
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,320
acute malnutrition our Aid makes a

1374
01:23:29,698 --> 01:23:33,899
difference

[Music]

1376
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:39,179
we have a responsibility to help those

1377
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:41,219
in need and I will always fight to

1378
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:44,219
protect those who cannot protect

1379
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:44,219
themselves

1380
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:49,920
in this year's government funding bills

1381
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:53,519
we have an opportunity to make

1382
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:57,420
investments that will save lives and pay

1383
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:59,760
for dividends for years to come stay

1384
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:03,960
strong and let's keep up the good fight

1385
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:06,420
to end extreme poverty Global Citizens

1386
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,600

make this happen

1396
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:40,140
but we here know that we cannot stop

1397
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:42,480
calling for Action we know that we have

1398
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:45,300
shown up time and time again and world

1399
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:47,339
leaders are still not doing enough so

1400
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:49,260
today we're gonna do a little chant and

1401
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:52,500
we need them that we need them to hear

1402
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:55,920
us loud and clear so I'm gonna ask what

1403
01:24:52,500 --> 01:25:00,420
do we need action action when do we need

1404
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:04,739
it now what do we need action when do we

1405
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:07,579
need it now what do we need action when

1406
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:07,579
do we need it

1407
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:16,679
thank you

1408
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:18,779
my name is Louis Pugh I'm an endurance

1409
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:21,658
swimmer I'm the UN patron of the oceans

1410
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:23,158
and for over 30 years now I've been

1411
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:26,099
swimming in the world's oceans and

1412
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:30,319
rivers trying to shine a light on how

1413
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,320
important it is for us to protect them

1414
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:35,819
now behind me you'll see an incredibly

1415
01:25:33,179 --> 01:25:37,440
beautiful River this is the Hudson River

1416
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:39,198
and it's one of the most incredible

1417
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,819
rivers in the world I mean which river

1418
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:44,219
starts high up in a Wilderness Area

1419
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:47,158
where their turkey vultures beavers and

1420
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:49,619
bears and ends in one of the greatest

1421
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:53,639
cities on this Earth

1422
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:56,219
and the reason why I swam 315 miles down

1423
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,739
the Hudson was to highlight just how

1424
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:00,779
important it is that we protect our

1425
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:02,939
Rivers the health of the Hudson has

1426
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:07,019
significantly improved in the last 50

1427
01:26:02,939 --> 01:26:10,460
years but we must remain vigilant

1428
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:10,460
your voice matters

1429
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:20,939

whoa I know it's wet Where You Are

1435
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:41,880
I love that song check this out people

1436
01:26:39,139 --> 01:26:44,699
you may think you're wet but this man

1437
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:47,699
just swam an average of five hours a day

1438
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:50,819
for 30 days straight the length of the

1439
01:26:47,698 --> 01:26:52,919
entire Hudson River and an extraordinary

1440
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:54,479
feat of endurance my friend that is

1441
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,719
really something today

1442
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:59,819
uh you've swapped your swimsuit but

1443
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:01,198
given the weather I'm not sure you you

1444
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:03,960
made the right choice maybe you should

1445
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:06,839
have kept it on uh you're here with the

1446
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,020
message of hope that we can protect the

1447
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,420
world's Rivers precisely bill you know

1448
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,880
50 years ago the Hudson was one of the

1449
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,619
most polluted rivers in America

1450
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,300
and a swim like this would have been

1451
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:22,380
absolutely impossible

1452
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:25,139
but in the 1970s New Yorkers said enough

1453
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:29,340
is enough and they started cleaning it

1454
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:31,739
up mile by mile town after town Factory

1455
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,239
after Factory and they turned the fate

1456
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:36,178
of it around

1457
01:27:33,238 --> 01:27:38,698
we must never become complacent when it

1458
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:41,039
comes to protecting the environment and

1459
01:27:38,698 --> 01:27:44,158
we must always be vigilant

1460
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:47,399
there is still a threat from sewage and

1461
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:49,920
chemicals entering the river but I

1462
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:54,000
believe the Hudson gives hope to people

1463
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:57,500
all over the world that their Rivers can

1464
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,500
also be saved

1465
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:03,779
our Rivers sustain human livelihoods and

1466
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:06,120
support countless

1467
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:08,880
threatens their very assistance it

1468
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:11,519
threatens all of ours too we can't have

1469
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:15,239
a healthy Planet without healthy Rivers

1470
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,219
they are the arteries of our world this

1471
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:20,099
is why the rivers are life campaign

1472
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:22,739
calls on world leaders to prioritize

1473
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:25,800
clean rivers as part of their commitment

1474
01:28:22,738 --> 01:28:29,229

the bottom line is that all our Rivers

1479
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,520
should be drinkable fishable and

1480
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,519

with love dream and happiness I hope to

1866
01:54:01,859 --> 01:54:08,880
see the United States and other nations

1867
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:11,659

thank you thank you thank you thank you

and enjoy the show thank you

1874
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:43,319
non-profits are on the front lines of

1875
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:45,780
the world's most pressing social needs

1876
01:54:43,319 --> 01:54:47,698
you donate to Great causes with the hope

1877
01:54:45,779 --> 01:54:50,279
that every dollar you give arrives at

1878
01:54:47,698 --> 01:54:52,678
its destination quickly and efficiently

1879
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:54,479
what you don't know is that behind the

1880
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:57,179
scenes many nonprofits are forced to use

1881
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,979
Tech that charges ridiculous fees these

1882
01:54:57,179 --> 01:55:01,260
platforms can also be cumbersome and

1883
01:54:58,979 --> 01:55:03,419
hard to use causing non-profits to lose

1884
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:05,400
valuable time that could be better spent

global citizen

2179
02:15:37,139 --> 02:15:42,239
so listen when I was 15 years old I had

2180
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:43,800
an abortion and this isn't the first

2181
02:15:42,238 --> 02:15:45,899
time that I've talked about this

2182
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:49,860
publicly it's not going to be the last

2183
02:15:45,899 --> 02:15:52,500
because as you all hear no women girls

2184
02:15:49,859 --> 02:15:55,319
people with uteruses are currently being

2185
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:58,738
denied the right to make Health Care

2186
02:15:55,319 --> 02:16:01,799
decisions about their own bodies

2187
02:15:58,738 --> 02:16:05,339
and without bodily autonomy there will

2188
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:08,460
never be true equality women and girls

2189
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:11,279
everywhere share a common desire for

2190
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:14,239

2191
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:18,359
health the freedom to plan our future

2192
02:16:14,238 --> 02:16:21,059
the freedom to make our own choices but

2193
02:16:18,359 --> 02:16:23,460
right now in this country the state you

2194
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:26,639
live in determines if you have any

2195
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:29,279
reproductive Freedom it determines if

2196
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:31,340
you control your own body

2197
02:16:29,279 --> 02:16:35,939
more than

2198
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:38,939
257 million women and girls worldwide do

2199
02:16:35,939 --> 02:16:42,300
not have access to any safe modern form

2200
02:16:38,939 --> 02:16:44,760
of contraceptions we have the power to

2201
02:16:42,299 --> 02:16:47,218
change this if we work together as

2202
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:50,280
Global Citizens

2203
02:16:47,218 --> 02:16:53,638
we've already proved that we can create

2204
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:56,639
change together and over the last two

2205
02:16:53,638 --> 02:17:00,299
decades maternal mortality rates have

2206
02:16:56,638 --> 02:17:03,478
dropped by a third but that progress has

2207
02:17:00,299 --> 02:17:07,319
stalled and in some areas it has even

2208
02:17:03,478 --> 02:17:10,438
reversed the denial of your sexual and

2209
02:17:07,319 --> 02:17:14,579
reproductive health is a violation of

2210
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:17,880
your human rights it cannot be tolerated

2211
02:17:14,579 --> 02:17:20,638
we must demand stronger and better

2212
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:24,079
resource Health Systems and we must

2213
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:24,079
demand them now

2214
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:30,120
unfpa the United Nations sexual and

2215
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:33,420
reproductive health agency plays a vital

2216
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:34,979
role in empowering women globally by

2217
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:38,719
providing them with access to

2218
02:17:34,978 --> 02:17:42,718
contraception with enough funding

2219
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:46,079
unfpa supplies could prevent 24 million

2220
02:17:42,718 --> 02:17:51,478
unplanned pregnancies more than 6

2221
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:54,478
million unsafe abortions and over 500

2222
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:56,420
000 maternal and child deaths in the

2223
02:17:54,478 --> 02:18:00,179
next three years

2224
02:17:56,420 --> 02:18:03,478
Global Citizens you have been taking

2225
02:18:00,179 --> 02:18:06,840
action with us to call on world leaders

2226
02:18:03,478 --> 02:18:09,478
and change makers to fill unfpa's

2227
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:12,239
funding Gap you called for new

2228
02:18:09,478 --> 02:18:15,659
commitments from governments from the

2229
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:20,000
private sector and philanthropists and

2230
02:18:15,659 --> 02:18:20,000
one leader has responded

2231
02:18:21,898 --> 02:18:27,119
High Global Citizens I don't often get

2232
02:18:25,019 --> 02:18:29,939
to share a stage with such amazing

2233
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:32,340
performers but I'm very proud to do so

2234
02:18:29,939 --> 02:18:34,939
today and to talk about an issue that is

2235
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:37,260
so important to me the global

2236
02:18:34,939 --> 02:18:39,359
contraceptive crisis

2237
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:41,040
after all when we talk about birth

2238
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:45,239
control we're talking about women's

2239
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:48,359
power agency and self-respect right now

2240
02:18:45,239 --> 02:18:50,638
far too many women around the world want

2241
02:18:48,359 --> 02:18:51,800
access to birth control but they can't

2242
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:55,199
get it

2243
02:18:51,799 --> 02:18:56,759
unfpa supplies is working hard to fix

2244
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:59,460
that

2245
02:18:56,760 --> 02:19:01,859
with the necessary funding they could

2246
02:18:59,459 --> 02:19:05,098
get contraceptives to more than 30

2247
02:19:01,859 --> 02:19:06,420
million women and adolescent girls every

2248
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:09,960
single year

2249
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:13,920
that's 30 million women and girls who

2250
02:19:09,959 --> 02:19:15,898
could decide for themselves if and when

2251
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:18,599
to have children

2252
02:19:15,898 --> 02:19:21,659
this week the Gates Foundation announced

2253
02:19:18,599 --> 02:19:24,799
we're committing 100 million dollars to

2254
02:19:21,659 --> 02:19:28,260
unfpa supplies over the next five years

2255
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:30,659
and I'm glad to say that others are also

2256
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:33,780
stepping up with commitments to narrow

2257

of leaders meeting all week promises

2545
02:39:03,299 --> 02:39:07,858
made seven years ago and today we're

02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:31,380
use of their power to keep the promises

2556
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:34,020
of the global goals

2557
02:39:31,379 --> 02:39:35,579
and they risk breaking that promise to

2558
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:38,520
billions of people

2559
02:39:35,579 --> 02:39:42,120
the good news is we still got seven

2560
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:43,859
years to go and every game is won or

2561
02:39:42,120 --> 02:39:46,620

world we can't do this alone we need all

2571
02:40:08,879 --> 02:40:14,398
hands on deck and we need each and every

2572
02:40:11,398 --> 02:40:17,398
one of you we need leaders to urgently

2573
02:40:14,398 --> 02:40:19,439
tackle the climate crisis because we

2574
02:40:17,398 --> 02:40:20,519

02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:22,859
heating up

2576
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:26,100

leaders to achieve gender equality

2581
02:40:34,139 --> 02:40:39,899
because we can't win when half the team

2582
02:40:37,799 --> 02:40:42,959
isn't even on the field

2583
02:40:39,899 --> 02:40:45,359

awareness and I'm here to do that too

2648
02:44:09,898 --> 02:44:13,799
there was a time in a life where I

2649
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,920
struggled to put food on the table for

2650
02:44:13,799 --> 02:44:19,259
my family I was working and on public

2651
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:22,200
assistance but it wasn't enough no

2652
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:25,500
matter how hard I worked so I started

2653
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:28,200
advocating it's not always easy for me

2654
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:31,079
to share my story it started with me

2655
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:34,640
fighting for my family but turned into

2656
02:44:31,079 --> 02:44:36,318
fighting for Global Solutions

02:44:34,639 --> 02:44:39,599

through all of my work tackling food

2664
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:59,398
insecurity because no one in the world

02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:11,760
global hunger and displaced women and

2669
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:14,398

2677
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:36,060

2956
03:12:03,959 --> 03:12:07,559
one thing we're doing here at Pepperwood

2957
03:12:05,579 --> 03:12:09,719

2960
03:12:11,398 --> 03:12:16,318

Cisco thank you Sophia

3385
03:37:26,879 --> 03:37:32,879
and you are so right the private sector

3386
03:37:30,659 --> 03:37:36,000
must play its part

3387
03:37:32,879 --> 03:37:39,599
at Cisco we've set a goal for net zero

3388
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:41,639
emissions by 2040 and we're evolving to

3389
03:37:39,600 --> 03:37:45,960
a circular business model

3390
03:37:41,639 --> 03:37:49,619
and in 2021 The Cisco foundation made a

3391
03:37:45,959 --> 03:37:52,079
100 million dollar commitment to fund

3392
03:37:49,620 --> 03:37:54,420
climate Solutions over 10 years did you

3393
03:37:52,079 --> 03:37:58,439
hear that 100 million

3394
03:37:54,420 --> 03:38:01,559
give the climate all your money

3395
03:37:58,439 --> 03:38:04,200
we need to invest in Innovative early

3396
03:38:01,559 --> 03:38:07,260
stage programs around the world

3397
03:38:04,200 --> 03:38:10,920
an amazing example of a foundation

3398
03:38:07,260 --> 03:38:12,898
recipient is Cara solar which trains

3399
03:38:10,920 --> 03:38:16,439
indigenous community members as

3400
03:38:12,898 --> 03:38:18,719
technicians who own and operate solar

3401
03:38:16,439 --> 03:38:21,420
shuttle boats in rainforest communities

3402
03:38:18,719 --> 03:38:21,549
how amazing is that

3403
03:38:21,420 --> 03:38:24,478
[Applause]

3404
03:38:21,549 --> 03:38:27,840
[Music]

3405
03:38:24,478 --> 03:38:30,539
much like the American climate core this

3406
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:33,359
initiative equips people with skills in

3407
03:38:30,540 --> 03:38:36,840
the clean energy economy while also

3408
03:38:33,359 --> 03:38:41,399
reducing pollution and deforestation

3409
03:38:36,840 --> 03:38:44,700
everyone this is just one example we

3410
03:38:41,398 --> 03:38:47,579
need to usher in a more inclusive a more

3411
03:38:44,700 --> 03:38:50,040
sustainable future for all

3412
03:38:47,579 --> 03:38:53,700
and all of that starts

3413
03:38:50,040 --> 03:38:55,260
with giving Mother Nature a voice thank

3414
03:38:53,700 --> 03:38:58,159

right here right now being stylish

3417
03:39:03,238 --> 03:39:10,199
doesn't have to cost us a planet

3418
03:39:06,840 --> 03:39:13,079
it's crazy and not intuitive but there

3419
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:15,060
are more than 300 million trees that are

3420
03:39:13,079 --> 03:39:17,639
cut down every year to make textiles

3421
03:39:15,059 --> 03:39:19,439
that end up in the suit lining and the

3422
03:39:17,639 --> 03:39:21,898
t-shirts and the dresses that we all

3423
03:39:19,439 --> 03:39:23,939
wear canopy with the support of the

3424
03:39:21,898 --> 03:39:26,099
Cisco Foundation Works to transform

3425
03:39:23,939 --> 03:39:28,020
unsustainable Supply chains that are

3426
03:39:26,100 --> 03:39:30,540
currently driving deforestation and

3427
03:39:28,020 --> 03:39:32,880
Forest degradation because together we

3428
03:39:30,540 --> 03:39:34,859
can protect vital forest ecosystems

3429
03:39:32,879 --> 03:39:37,259

3430
03:39:34,859 --> 03:39:40,859

3493
03:42:03,120 --> 03:42:09,840
yet nearly a billion people experienced

3494
03:42:06,719 --> 03:42:12,659
hunger last year our Global Food system

3495
03:42:09,840 --> 03:42:16,380

03:42:12,659 --> 03:42:19,260

3557
03:45:34,500 --> 03:45:40,379
climate change has greatly impacted my

3558
03:45:37,978 --> 03:45:43,019
beautiful home my grandmother had a

3559
03:45:40,379 --> 03:45:45,659
thriving backyard gardens but due to sea

3560
03:45:43,020 --> 03:45:48,359
level rise which led to an increase in

3561
03:45:45,659 --> 03:45:51,299
Social salinity we're unable to Quant

3562
03:45:48,359 --> 03:45:53,760
and we have to depend on food cubes and

3563
03:45:51,299 --> 03:45:56,340
plant above throat and because of this

3564
03:45:53,760 --> 03:45:59,219
my people have to rely on imported foods

3565
03:45:56,340 --> 03:46:02,639
which leads to an increase in ncds such

3566
03:45:59,219 --> 03:46:04,379
as diabetes high blood pressure also due

3567
03:46:02,639 --> 03:46:06,299
to climate change there has been an

03:46:04,379 --> 03:46:09,119
increase in temperature which has led to

3569

frequent droughts what frustrates me the

3570
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:15,180
most is that people are still talking

3571
03:46:12,079 --> 03:46:18,238

3572
03:46:15,180 --> 03:46:20,760

that emerges when voices unite as one

3676
03:56:50,459 --> 03:56:55,500

they're from Ecuador yasuni yes

4380
04:57:49,099 --> 04:57:55,619
yasuni National Park in Ecuador is known

4381
04:57:52,439 --> 04:57:59,099
as the most biodiverse place on the

4382
04:57:55,619 --> 04:58:01,860
planet with more species of life than

4383
04:57:59,099 --> 04:58:04,680
any other place in the world

4384
04:58:01,860 --> 04:58:07,619
beneath it all is a massive reserve of

4385
04:58:04,680 --> 04:58:11,099
crude oil but now thanks to the

4386
04:58:07,619 --> 04:58:15,378
referendum that just passed that oil

4387
04:58:11,099 --> 04:58:15,377
will stay firmly in the ground

4388
04:58:16,979 --> 04:58:24,479
Nina tell them about it yes the victory

4389
04:58:20,819 --> 04:58:27,000
for yasuni was the result of Decades of

4390
04:58:24,479 --> 04:58:29,759
work led by the indigenous and

4391
04:58:27,000 --> 04:58:33,770
environmental movements in Ecuador

4392
04:58:29,759 --> 04:58:36,739
especially young people and women

4394
04:58:36,740 --> 04:58:43,500
yasuni's oil has been exploited for many

4395
04:58:40,137 --> 04:58:46,860
years but now thanks to the referendum

4396
04:58:43,500 --> 04:58:50,520
not only will the land be protected from

4397
04:58:46,860 --> 04:58:53,200
further harm but the oil companies will

4398
04:58:50,520 --> 04:58:54,930
be forced to leave

4399

world leaders have failed to keep their

4402
04:59:00,180 --> 04:59:07,319
promises to face out fossil fuels so we

4403
04:59:04,080 --> 04:59:10,980
the people of Ecuador have taken things

4404
04:59:07,319 --> 04:59:14,099
into our own hands the referendum was

4405
04:59:10,979 --> 04:59:15,930
the first of its kind but it will not be

4406
04:59:14,099 --> 04:59:18,599
the last right

4407
04:59:15,930 --> 04:59:22,740

4408
04:59:18,599 --> 04:59:26,279
young and Indigenous peoples know how to

4409
04:59:22,740 --> 04:59:29,280
take care of the planet we must respect

4410
04:59:26,279 --> 04:59:32,279
indigenous rights and protect those

4411
04:59:29,279 --> 04:59:35,279

4416
04:59:44,159 --> 04:59:52,218
allowing fossil fuel expansion in places

4417
04:59:47,939 --> 04:59:55,079
such as our home the Amazon

4418
04:59:52,218 --> 04:59:59,159
we need to hold these leaders

4419
04:59:55,080 --> 05:00:02,480
accountable if Ecuador can begin the

4420
04:59:59,159 --> 05:00:09,137
process of phasing out fossil fuels

4421
05:00:02,479 --> 05:00:09,137
others countries can and must do so too

4422
05:00:11,878 --> 05:00:19,260
