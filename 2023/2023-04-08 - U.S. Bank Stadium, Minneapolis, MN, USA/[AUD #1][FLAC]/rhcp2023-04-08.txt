Notes: Iâ€™m gonna make a similar comment on this recording much like the Fargo recording; not one of my better efforts. For those who care to grab the audio, it is listenable, but lacks consistency at times. Minneapolis is a wonderful city and U.S. Bank Arena is indeed a beautiful venue. Add to it, a Hall of Fame musical group, a large energetic crowd and a memorable experience is guaranteed! Unlike Fargo, I was on the floor, at the rear of the stage. I was surrounded by many who enjoyed getting their earholes filled with the finest musical sensations to be offered. Of the thousands served, more left the show with great satisfaction than disappointment. The audio was created for RHCP LiveArchive and all fans of this wonderful band!
