The second known TV inreview by The Red Hot Chili Peppers (Anthony "Swan" Kiedis, Michael "Flea" Balzary, Jack "Shermdog" Sherman, Cliff Martinez). Independent "Cutting Edge" TV show. Includes parts of the band rehearsal prior to debut album US tour & some interviews. Sadly this version does not contain Jack Sherman's interview. For the last 16 years the only available known version was a full one (with Sherman interview) but in a very poor quality. The second known Red Hot Chili Peppers live video with Jack Sherman (the first one - Thicke of the Night).

Jack Sherman told me about this filming: "CUTTING EDGE, was filmed at a place we were rehearsing that I believe belonged to the band WAR. On Sunset Boulevard across the street for the original Guitar Center. When, I see the footage, I think, that I was maybe, a little too serious. I guess, I was very serious back then".

The location: the rehearsal space at Sunset Boulevard, near the Guitar Centre.

Date: July 1984, broadcaster August 26, 1984.
