Recording Info:
tape cut after "Fire". No music missing. A buddy of mine bought this tape from a mail order place sometime in the mid-90s. He later gave it to me, and I got rid of it soon thereafter, but not before dubbing a copy for myself. A couple years went by and I thought I lost my tape, but recently found it (Dec 2005) and transferred it to CDR.
