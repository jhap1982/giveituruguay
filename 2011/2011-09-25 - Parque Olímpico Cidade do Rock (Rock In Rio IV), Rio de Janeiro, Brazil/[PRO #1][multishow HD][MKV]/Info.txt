Hi there.

Here is the full show. Aired on Multishow HD.
All I did was getting the transport stream, trimmed junk at the beginning and end of the file, and remuxed to a mkv container.
It's HD, but in my opinion the image is not all that great. But, of course, better than the SD I uploaded before.



Here is some info taken with MediaInfo:
