Red Hot Chili Peppers2011-10-08 
Veltins Arena
Gelsenkirchen, GermanyDie große TV total Stock Car Crash Challenge 2011
ProSieben (Pro7) TV broadcast 2011-10-08

This is from a German TV show with TV total presenter Stefan Raab as a race driver, therefore the title "Die große TV total Stock Car Crash Challenge 2011". Fortunately the Red Hot Chili Peppers made a side trip between two tour dates in Germany to perform at the Veltins Arena (or "auf Schalke" as the Germans would say) and they played three songs at two different points in the show, therefore there are two .ts files in the folder.
