Notes:
It's time to get a new recorder, this one has something like a loose contact, it lost the power supply because of my movement (I was sitting and had to stand up), so it didn't save the first part of the recordings (tracks 01 - 08). When I noticed this, I started another recording and barely moved, I stopped the recorder at the encore break and fortunately the MZ-RH 1 saved the file. Then I started recording again, but probably moved accidently again, so once more the recorder lost its power supply and the 3rd part (tracks 17 - 20) was lost, it's a shame.

Show Notes:
First show after more than 4 years of absence, so I was excited to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers again (not as much as I would have been if JF would still be in the band). And the performance was as powerful as you can imagine, Rockin' keeps you young and alive. And even as a diehard Frusciante fan I cannot find much to nag about Josh, he is good and judging from his performance he seems to totally enjoy being the Chili Peppers' guitarist.

The light show was absolutely amazing, check out photos or videos if you have not seen a recent show. According to Flea the Cologne show was the premiere of this light show, including animated pills spinning round during Californication, huge 3D chemical formulas during Otherside or a swarm of birds during Rain Dance Maggie. From the upper tier, where we were seated, it was a great watch and sometimes made me forget to look at the band.

Other thing I remember was the jumping in the pit, it's cool to see that from above for a change. And Chad threw many sticks, at the end of the show he managed to throw one near to the soundboard, an impressive distance.
