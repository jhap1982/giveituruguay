Notes:
Video quality is pretty good, I made the mix from the original raw HD videos I got from tapers - they're not grabbed from YouTube. Audio is not that good since it's from audience. I decided not to use the FM recording due to its low quality (online broadcast) and the DJ speaking over the music, but it's still listeneable.
