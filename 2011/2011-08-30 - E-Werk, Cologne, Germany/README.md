## Notes

> "I'm with You" was performed in sequence for a special event broadcasted via satellite to select movie theaters around the world. Although the event was promoted as a full album performance, the band decided not to perform "Even You Brutus?", apparently as Flea plays both bass and piano on the song. "Californication" is seen on the handwritten setlist, but was replaced with a second "Did I Let You Know" performance, as technical issues were present during the first.
