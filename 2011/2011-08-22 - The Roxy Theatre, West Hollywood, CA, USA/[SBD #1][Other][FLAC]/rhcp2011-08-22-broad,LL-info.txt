According to some written reports, the track - "Did I Let You Know" 
(the live concert premiere of it) was actually performed next after 
"Me And My Friends" at this particular show. Apparently the group 
nixed the airing of it for the Fuse broadcast; and, if you very 
listen closely, it does appear to be slight evidence of an edit 
there as you can lightly hear a count-in to simply a little more 
applause, the track "Californication" then continues the show.


This fileset might be burned onto 80 min. CD-R sucessfully, or a 
suggestion might be a disc split after track 10 for a 2 CD-R set.
