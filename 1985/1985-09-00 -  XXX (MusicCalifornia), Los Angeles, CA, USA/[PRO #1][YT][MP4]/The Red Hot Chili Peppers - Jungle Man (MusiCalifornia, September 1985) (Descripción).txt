A small fragment of The Red Hot Chili Peppers' performance at the MusiCalifornia TV show, early September 1985. Some parts of this video were used by Lindy Goetz for "Jungle Man" officia; music video. 
The full MusiCalifornia show had two versions of "Jungle Man" - with live sound & playback sound (as this one), jam session & an interview where Flea & Hillel Slovak showed the cover art of "Freaky Styley" lp. 
I uploaded this video on Youtube back in the Summer of 2006, but the old channel was closed & the video never appeared anywhere during the next 16 years.
The band: Anthony Kiedis - vocals, Michael Balzary - bass guitar, Hillel Slovak - guitar, Cliff Martinez - drums.
