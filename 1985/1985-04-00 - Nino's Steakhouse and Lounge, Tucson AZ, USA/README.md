> **UNCONFIRMED PERFORMANCE**
<br>
Anthony mentions this show on his autobiography: "We were about to go to Michigan to record our second album, but first, Lindy, our manager, had booked us a gig in a steakhouse disco in Arizona. The promoter was a fan of ours and he was going to pay us more than we were worth and we all needed the money, so we agreed to play".
