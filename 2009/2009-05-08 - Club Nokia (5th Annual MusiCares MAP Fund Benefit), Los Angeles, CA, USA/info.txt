Note: The RHCP hiatus followed after the last leg of the Stadium Arcadium tour in 2007.
Anthony Kiedis explained that he was preoccupied with taking care of his new son. Flea began taking music theory classes at the University of Southern California. John Frusciante continued his solo career and released his solo album, "The Empyrean". Chad Smith worked in the supergroup Chickenfoot, as well as on his solo project, Bombastic Meatbats.
The band initially planned to remain on hiatus for a minimum of one year but eventually extended it to two years.
This was the 5th annual MusiCares® MAP Fund® benefit concert and although it was not made public yet, John Frusciante had already left the band for the second time.
On December 18th, a few days after the rumour first started John did a clarification: "When I quit the band, over a year ago, we were on an indefinite hiatus. There was no drama or anger involved, and the other guys were very understanding. They are supportive of my doing whatever makes me happy and that goes both ways".
