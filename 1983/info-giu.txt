[1983-01-06][1983-01-20] Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem

Note: Originally known as Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem, the sock on cock thing made the band famous in the L.A. scene in 1983. The band that would become that same year the "Red Hot Chili Peppers" actually made a name for themselves after a gig at a local strip joint called the Kit Kat Club. The people were concentrating much more on the girls than on themselves so they returned for the encore wearing nothing but socks over their manhoods.


[1983-03-05][1983-11-23]

Note: The Cathay De Grande show was supposedly the first they did as "The Red Hot Chili Peppers". Around this time, the band kept jamming songs by day and rocking the Rhythm Lounge by night. This went on until they had about 9 songs.
