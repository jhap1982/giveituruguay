Recording Notes: 
All three sets are sourced directly from the master, including the elusive RHCP set which seems like it 
has never circulated very much, if at all. Edited to even out some volume adjustments the taper did at 
the beginning of the PJ and Nirvana sets, smoothed out where the taper paused after "Dumb" and "Me and My
Friends", and removed a few pops. There is also an unfixable small cut @ 9:28 of disc 3, track 6.

The total time of the first disc is 80:33. Almost all modern cd burners can overburn to a little over 82 minutes 
using capable burning software. Check out the net for specifics on what your particular burner can handle, or 
you can of course separate the two sets onto two discs if you have any problems.

This release should not be confused with SV023, called "JAM LIKE HELL". Basically the differences between that
earlier release and this one is SV023 does not include the RHCP set, and there are more cdr extractions in the 
source lineage.

Also very special thanks to Dominick Gruber in Germany who spent a good bit of time helping me identify all 
the teases in the RHCP set.

Artwork Notes:
The artwork is designed to fit a 3-cd fat "quad" cd style jewelcase. It could be surely modified to fit two
separate traditional jewelcases if desired.

Show Notes (thanks to Five Horizons):
New Year's Eve and three great bands! Ed comments, "If I wasn't in this band, I would still make sure I was here 
tonight." Ed sings part of Fugazi's 'Waiting Room' as an intro to 'Even Flow.' A driven performance, with a 
particularly intense version of 'Alive.' Flea of RHCP assists with vocals during 'Leash.' The 'Teen Spirit' teaser 
(actually the longest teaser I've heard) is followed by Stone's quip, "Just remember, we played it first." Ed 
performs one of his finest stage dives, repeating it later during the 'Yurtle the Turtle' encore with the Chili 
Peppers.
