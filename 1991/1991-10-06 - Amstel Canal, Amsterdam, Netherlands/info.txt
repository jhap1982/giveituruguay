This was an amazing acoustic performance for the VPRO. 
Anthony and John where sitting on a boat and going on the Amstel canal in Amsterdam performing a beautiful acoustic set of Peppers songs and covers (I think the broadcast does not include the whole show and therefore the setlist is probably incomplete).
