Notes:
First This Is The Place since 2003 (according to setlist.fm)

Private set played after WeWork Global Creator Awards Finals. Occasional chatter from 
nearby employees. Cut encore noise due to conversational chatter. Seemed to be some mic
issues for the first few songs but otherwise sound was pretty consistent.
