No major issues recording wise in regards to talkers, clappers, etc. Most of Can't Stop is sans guitar as there was a power outage on the stage. After it was rectified it takes a couple of songs for the sound guy to dial in the correct mix. The cymbals sound a little washy at times, but after watching footage from different locations in the venue, it wasn't contained to my specific location and just seems to be a mic'ing/mixing issue. I also swear they turned off the aircon in the building to ensure there was enough power available on stage after the power outage. It would have been at least 40 degrees celsius up where I was, can't imagine what it would have been like on the floor where they were packed in like sardines.
