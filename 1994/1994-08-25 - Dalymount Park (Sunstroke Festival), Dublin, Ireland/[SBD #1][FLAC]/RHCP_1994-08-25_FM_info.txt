NOTES:
This goody comes from the Irish RTÉ 2fm radio broadcast, aired in 1994, which I've transferred from a master cassette. The broadcast has been sanitized meaning there has been some editing over offensive words. Apparently "Pea" was in the set as well but it was not broadcast for obvious reasons. I assume it was played after "Higher Ground" as Anthony Kiedis sings a few lines of it before they start "My Lovely Man". "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" cuts at its ending due to the tape filp, other than that nothig of the broadcast is missing.

All credits go to Stephen Mahon, who not only witnessed this performance live as it took place, but also lent me his cassette master for releasing this uncircualted recording almost 20 years after the show's happening!!
