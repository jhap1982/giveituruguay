1. Warped
2. Pea
3. Aeroplane
4. Walkabout
5. Me and My Friends
<br>**SETLIST INCOMPLETE**

## Notes

> The band played two suprise, unannounced shows in Los Angeles in late May 1994. Clippings are from Star-Bulletin (Jun 8 1994) and RAW magazine (July 1994).
The articles mention the premiere of four new songs, one of them being "Walkabout". Our guess is the other three might be "Warped", "Pea" and "Aeroplane" as those were the other new songs played during the 1994 tour.
Sellout only opened at the Dragonfly on Tuesdays. The Star Bulletin article mentions the band playing the previous week, hence the show happened on May 31st.
