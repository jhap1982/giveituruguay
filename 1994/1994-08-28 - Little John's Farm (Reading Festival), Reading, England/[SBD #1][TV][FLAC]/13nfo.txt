Someone, somewhere was asking me about an RHCP show with Dave Navarro. This is one of the best I've heard, though to be honest, as much as I love Navarro's work his stint in the Pepper's never really did it for me. It was a strange chemistry that didn't seem to work quite right. Of course, I still miss Hillel, that was the real deal.

Anyway, a solid performance, a nice set and Navarro's guitar noodlings fill this out well, and the remastering brought it to a full onslaught of sonic goodness.
Or something like that.
