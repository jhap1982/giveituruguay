[1994-08-10][1994-10-21]

Note: Dave joined the band on September 5, 1993 but his first show with the guys was only in 1994 for a secret gig in L.A. Most people think his first show was Woodstock but it actually was at the "Club Lingerie". The band had already written a few new songs at the time but "One Hot Minute" would not be released until September 1995.
