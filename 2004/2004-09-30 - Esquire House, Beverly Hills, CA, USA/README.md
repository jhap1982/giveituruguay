## Notes

> The band and Perry Farrell played a backyard party gig in benefit of the Autism Coalition and Surfers Healing foundations. Setlist is missing a few songs and according to a Rolling Stone review, they also played an "untitled, up-tempo new song" (most likely "21st Century").
Farrell performed “My Time” with Flea and John Frusciante and “Oceanside” with Flea and Nuno Bettencourt.
