RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS PLAY TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN LONDON'S HYDE PARK

The RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS played the first of three live shows in London's Hyde Park on Saturday night (19JUN04), to an appreciative audience estimated to number 100,000.

As hundreds of ticketless fans swarmed outside the gates hoping to get into the site, ticket touts were reportedly asking for as much as £90 (sterling) a ticket.

Stars reportedly watching the show included Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe and illusionist David Blaine.

The Hyde Park shows are part of a UK tour which has already taken the American rock band to Manchester and Edinburgh, and will see them play the Millennium Stadium on Cardiff on Wednesday 23 June.

The tour is set to be the biggest taking place in the UK this year, with the band playing to more than 500,000 people over just six days.

The band will play their second Hyde Park concert this evening (Sunday 20 June), and will return for their third and final London show on Friday 25 June.
