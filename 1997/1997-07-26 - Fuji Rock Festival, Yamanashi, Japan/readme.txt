Notes
At the time the band wasn't aware, but this would be Dave's last show. Although the rest of the tour was cancelled due to Anthony breaking his right wrist on a motorcycle accident, this show was played.
Because of a heavy storm and a typhoon coming, the set was shortened and the rest of the performances for the festival had to be cancelled.
