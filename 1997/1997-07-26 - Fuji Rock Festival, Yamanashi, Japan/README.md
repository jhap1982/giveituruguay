## Notes

> At the time the band wasn't aware, but this would be Dave's last show. Although the rest of the tour was cancelled due to Anthony breaking his right wrist on a motorcycle accident, this show was played.
Because of a heavy storm and a typhoon coming, the set was shortened and the rest of the performances for the festival had to be cancelled.
